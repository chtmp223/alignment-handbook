G-R-R-R--R!  Thump!

"What was that?"

Jack Lakewood stuck his head out from the lower bunk as he almost
yelled the question.

"What's the matter now?" came in sleepy tones from the upper bunk.

"Sounded as though we'd struck something."

"Oh, go back to sleep, you've been having a nightmare."

"Night-mare nothing.  Listen."

A faint sound of voices reached their ears and, a moment later, the
sound of hurrying footsteps past the door of their state-room brought
Jack out into the middle of the room.

"I tell you we hit something," he cried.  "Don't you notice that the
engines have stopped?"

"You're right about that anyhow," Bob Lakewood replied as he slid
from the upper bunk to the floor.  "We'd better get dressed so as to
be on the safe side."

"I'll say we had," Jack agreed pulling off his pajamas.  "I don't
suppose it's anything--"

"All hands on deck, quick!"

The order was shouted outside their door to be repeated an instant
later further down the corridor.

"That sounds ominous," Bob declared pulling on his trowsers.

"I'll say it does.  We'd better make it snappy."

"Don't forget your money."

"And we'd better slip on a life preserver," Jack added as he pulled
two of them out from beneath the bunk.

"Wonder what we hit?" Bob asked as he strapped the life preserver
over his coat.

"Iceberg likely, or maybe a derelict."

"More likely the latter," Bob said.

"You ready?"

"Come on."

Bob pulled the door open and they stepped out into the corridor.  The
sound of voices some shrill and others low and gruff seemed to fill
the ship.  As they started toward the stairway, a little way back, a
half dressed woman, her arms filled with clothes, rushed up to them.

"Oh, what has happened?" she gasped.

"I'm afraid we hit something," Bob told her.

"Is the ship going to sink?" she cried.

"I hope not," Bob tried to reassure her.  "But you had better get
back to your state-room and finish dressing and put on a preserver."

"Are you sure there'll be time?"

"I think so.  Where is your room?"

"Just around the corner."

"Are you alone?"

"Yes, all alone.  Oh, this is awful.  I know the ship is going to
sink and we'll all be drowned."

"Come quick," Bob ordered taking hold of her arm and drawing her
along.  "Is this your room?" he asked as he turned a corner and saw a
door half open.

"This is it, yes."

"Then lose no time.  Put on the warmest thing you have and, as soon
as you're ready, I'll strap on your life preserver."

The woman slipped into the room and closed the door while he was
speaking.

"All hands on deck, and make it quick."

Doors were opening all along the corridor now and people, some fully
dressed and others only half clothed, were rushing toward the
stairway.

"Better put on life preservers," Bob yelled.

Some turned back at the suggestion while others in a state of frenzy
rushed along the corridor intent only on getting to the upper deck.

"Why doesn't she hurry?" Jack asked impatiently as he glanced both
ways.

"I'm ready."

The door was pushed open and the boys stepped in.  The woman, or
rather girl, for she could not have been more than twenty, was now
fully dressed and, reaching beneath the bunk, Bob dragged out a life
preserver and, an instant later, had it strapped securely about her.

"It's so brave and kind of you to wait for me," she whispered.

"Got a bag?" Bob asked.

"All my valuables are in this little bag," she replied picking up a
small leather bag from the bunk.  "I suppose I'll have to leave my
trunk here," she sighed.

"I'm afraid so," Bob said.  "And you'd better take the bag as we may
be separated," he added.

"All hands out on deck.  No time to lose."

"I'm ready," she cried, and the next moment they were hurrying along
the corridor evidently the last of those who had rooms in that part
of the ship.

"Do you think we're too late?" she gasped as they reached the foot of
the stairway.

"No, they'll have boats enough to hold everybody.  Have to since the
Titanic went down, you know," Bob told her as they started to mount
the stairs.

On deck the scene was one of indescribable confusion.  Officers were
rushing about shouting out orders and trying to calm the excited
passengers, while the creak of ropes as the life boats were lowered
added a sinister note to the occasion.  Cries of men trying to locate
their wives or children and of women separated from their loved ones,
added also to the confusion.

"Women and children first.  Stand back there or I'll fire."

The deck was lighted by many lights and the boys could see the
captain of the ship, close by the rail, as he endeavored to hold back
the swarm of fear crazed men from the steerage as they fought for a
place in each boat before it was lowered to the water.

But he might as well have tried to hold back the tide itself.  The
crowd, many of them foreigners, fought like wild beasts and there was
immediate danger that the brave captain would be overpowered.

"Come on, Jack boy, we've got to take a hand in this," Bob said in a
low voice as he grabbed the girl by the arm and urged her forward.

Holding her close as possible he pushed into the fighting mob closely
followed by Jack.

"Way for the lady," he shouted pushing a big Swede aside.

With a snort of anger the man aimed a blow for Bob's head but he saw
it coming in time to duck and the next instant he had planted a
beautiful right, with all his strength behind it, on the point of the
Swede's chin.  The man went down as though a sledge hammer had struck
him and, for an instant, the crowd gave way enabling them to reach
the captain's side.  A boat was just being lowered and, as Bob spied
an empty seat close up by the bow, he shouted:

"There's room for one more there, Captain."

"All right, but hurry," the captain cried.

Both boys helped the girl over the side into the boat and, a moment
later she vanished as it quickly slid down to the water.

There had been a moment's pause in the mad struggle for a place in
the boats but now, as another was swung over the side, the rush began
again.

"Back, you men.  Women and children first," the captain again shouted
waving his revolver.

"I've as mooch right ter save my life as a woman," shouted a big
German as he reached for the side of the swinging boat.

"Not on this boat, you haven't," Bob yelled as he seized the man by
the coat collar and yanked him back.

The man fell sprawling on the deck and, before he could scramble to
his feet, Bob had leaped onto the rail where he stood holding onto a
rope.  Lifting his free hand high in the air he shouted at the top of
his voice.

"Are you all cowards?  There are still women and children to go in
the boats.  Let's be men."

"Hurrah for the kid," shouted a voice some feet away.

The effect, whether of Bob's short speech or of the man's cheer, was
magical and Jack, who was directly in front of his brother, was quick
to take advantage of the lull in the mad struggle.

"Make way, now, for those women behind there," he shouted as he urged
aside those in front of him.

Like children the foreigners obeyed and in an instant he had opened
up a lane and was beckoning to a dozen women and as many children who
had been standing back despairing of being able to get to the boat.

"Quick, now," he ordered, motioning them to come.

They rushed after him and, a moment later another boat load was
lowered to the water.

Much the same scene had been taking place in other parts of the ship
where the boats were being filled under the supervision of the
officers, but nowhere had the confusion been so great as here.  And
now, it being pretty certain that all the women and children had been
placed in the boats, the men were allowed to take their places and
boat after boat was quickly filled and lowered.  In this work Bob and
Jack assisted the captain in keeping some semblance of order and that
officer was loud in his praise of their action.

"I don't know what I would have done had it not been for you," he
panted as, all the passengers in sight having found a place in the
life boats they had a moment's breathing spell.

"You think she'll go down?" Bob asked.

"No doubt of it.  See how she's settling in the bow."

A single glance was enough to convince even a land lubber that the
big ship was doomed.  Already the deck sloped sharply toward the bow
and in addition there was a decided list to port.

"You boys get into this boat," the captain ordered as two sailors
swung the last boat in sight over the side.  "I must make sure that
no one is left behind."  And, before they could say a word he was off
down the stairway.

There seemed nothing to do but obey his order and they lost no time
in climbing into the boat.

"Is this the last one?" Jack asked one of the sailors who was holding
on to the rope.

"No, there's three or four more on the upper deck but I reckon we
won't need 'em.  Most of the crew has gone already."

"Will he have time to make the round of the ship?" Bob asked
anxiously.

"Reckon so.  The mates are helpin' him.  She ought ter hold up
another fifteen minutes or so."

"What did we hit?" Jack asked.

"Nobody knows fer sure, but it must have been a derelict an' a sunken
one at that 'cause the lookout swears as how he was on his job an'
that there wasn't a thing in sight an' Toby's a good man all right."

"Probably you're right," Bob agreed.

At that moment two men came running from the stern of the ship and
Bob noticed that they wore the uniforms of first and second mates.

"Hasn't the captain come back yet?" the first mate asked anxiously.

"Not yet," one of the sailors replied.

"It's strange.  We left him below and he didn't have as much of the
ship to look through as we did, and he ought to be here."

"He'll have to hustle or he'll be too late," the second mate
declared.  "She's going to take her last dive before many minutes."

As he finished speaking all the lights suddenly went out.
Fortunately it was moonlight and they could see for some distance.

"Water's got up to the dynamos," the first mate announced.

"And what's more the wind's getting up too," the other mate said.

When the boys had first reached the deck there was only a light
breeze blowing, but it had been steadily increasing and now had grown
to a strong wind.

"We can't wait much longer," the second mate declared.  "What in the
world do you suppose is keeping him?"

"But you wouldn't go without him?" Bob suggested.

"I'd hate to, but there's no use in all of us going down."

"Which we're going to do if we're not off in less than ten minutes,"
the other added.  "I tell you she's going down mighty soon."

"Then let's go."

"But we can't leave him," Bob insisted.

"You jest watch us, matey," one of the sailors broke in as he sprang
over the rail into the boat still holding the lowering rope.

"Give me five minutes and I'll go see if I can find him," Bob
proposed.

"All right, but yer've got to hustle," the sailors agreed grudgingly.

Bob waited no longer, but dashed for the stairway.

"You go back, Jack," he shouted as he turned at the head of the
stairs and saw his brother close at his heels.

"Back nothing," the boy yelled.  "Now, don't stop to argue because it
won't do any good."

Bob knew his brother well enough to know that it would be useless to
say anything more so he leaped down the stairs and Jack followed.

"Oh, Captain!" he shouted as soon as he had reached the foot.

There was no answer.

"He must be up forward somewhere," Jack shouted as he started toward
the bow.

Fortunately the boys had had the foresight to slip into their pockets
their flashlights and, with their aid, they quickly located a door on
the far side of the large hall, which opened into a corridor leading
to the bow.  On both sides of this corridor were staterooms and into
these they peeped, Bob taking those on the right side while Jack
followed suit on the left.  But the captain was in none of them and
they reached the open deck in the bow without having discovered him.
From time to time they had called at the top of their voice without
result.

"If he's in this part of the boat he must be dead or unconscious,"
Bob declared as he threw the light from his flash over the deck.

"Well, there's no use standing here," Jack returned.  "There's a
passage on each side close to the rail.  You take one and I'll take
the other."

As Bob reached the right hand rail he noticed with a shudder of alarm
that the water was nearly on a level with the deck.  "She can't stay
afloat much longer," he thought as he pushed open the door of the
first room.

He had covered about half the rooms in the row when he heard a faint
cry from the other side of the ship.

"Bob--Bob.  This way, quick!"

Like a flash he sped down the corridor and, as he reached the other
side of the ship, he saw Jack standing about half way down the
passageway.

"Found him?" he yelled.

"Yes, he in this room, but I'm afraid he's dead."

By this time Bob was at the door of the stateroom and, a moment
later, was bending over the body of the captain who was stretched on
the floor face up.

"He isn't dead," he announced after he had laid his head on his chest.

"Then we've got to get him up.  You take his head and I'll take his
feet.  Quick now."

Fortunately the captain was not a large man and could not have
weighed over one hundred and forty pounds so they had little trouble
in carrying him.

"Wonder if they've waited," Jack panted as they came to the foot of
the stairs.

"We've been gone mor'n five minutes," Bob told him.

A moment later they had reached the middle deck and their first
glance was toward the rail where they had left the two mates and the
two sailors.

"They've gone!" Bob gasped.

"What do you know about that?  The cowards!" Jack added.



THE STRUGGLE.

Ten days previous to the events related in the preceding chapter Bob
and Jack Lakewood were preparing to return East for the fall term at
College.  They had spent the summer on the Lazy S ranch a few miles
from the little town of Cold Springs in the State of Texas, except
for a few weeks during which they had been in Mexico, hunting for a
lost mine.  It was late in October and ordinarily college would have
opened several weeks before but, owing to a serious outbreak of
influenza, the opening had been delayed, giving them several weeks
more of vacation.

The day before they were to start a telegram had come from their
father, bidding them to delay their departure until a letter, which
he had already sent, should reach them.

"That's funny," Bob said as he handed the telegram to Jack.

"What do you suppose is up?" Jack asked as soon as he had read it.

"Curiosity killed a cat, you know."

The last remark came from a girl with bobbed hair and a slightly
turned up nose, who had read the message over Jack's shoulder.  Her
name was Sue Stebbins and her father, Jeb Stebbins, was manager of
the large ranch which was owned by a Mr. Leeds who lived in the East.
Sue, who was something of a tomboy when it came to out-of-doors
sports, ruled all hands, including her father, with, as the latter
often declared, a rod of iron.  But her rule was a generous one and
she was a general favorite with all the hands from the manager down
to the Chinese cook.

"If that was so you'd have been dead long ago," Jack retorted.
"You've only got one life, you know, and a cat has nine."

"But I'm not curious," Sue pouted.

"Oh, no, not a bit," Jack jeered.

"Well, anyhow, it gives you a few days more before you have to go
back to that horrid old college," she smiled.

"Who said it was horrid?" Jack demanded.

"I did.  Anything that takes you two away from the ranch is horrid,
so there."

"I reckon that settles it," Bob broke in laughingly.  "But, honestly,
Sue, we hate to go worse than you can possibly hate to have us."

"Well, we won't argue the point.  Come on, there's just time for a
gallop before supper."

It was three days before the letter came and Bob read it with Jack
and Sue looking over his shoulder.  It was as follows:


My dear boys:

My wire undoubtedly was a great surprise to you and, of course, you
have been wondering what it was all about.

You will, no doubt, recall hearing me speak many times of my brother,
Silas, who lives in the State of Washington.  You have never seen him
as he is a bit queer and has not been East for nearly thirty years,
although he has always been a great rover.  About six months ago he
wrote me that he was going to take a trip to Alaska and try his hand
at mining.  Three months later I received a second letter from Nome
stating that he was about to start for the upper waters of the Yukon
with another man by the name of Long and that they would be gone a
month.  He promised that he would write as soon as they returned, but
I have no word from him and, frankly, I am worried.  He should have
been back two months ago and I should have heard from him a few days
later.

I have wired several times to Nome to find out if he had returned,
but each time have received a reply stating nothing had been heard
from them.

How would you like to take a trip up there and see if you can find
out what has become of him?  I know you ought to be in college, but
you are well up in your studies and the trip will be a new one for
you.  I would go myself, but business will not let me get away just
now.  If your friend, Slats Magee, can go with you so much the
better.  I am so sure that you will want to go that I am inclosing
check for expenses.  Wire what you will do.  Mother sends lots of
love as do I.

Your loving father.


"Do we go?" Bob asked as he finished reading.

"Does a duck swim?" Jack laughed.

"But Slats is laid up with a broken leg," Bob said mournfully.

"And, of course, that's too bad, but I reckon it needn't stop us from
going.  Father didn't say for us not to go without him, you know."

"I know, but--"

"But nothing.  Father wants us to go whether Slats can go or not and
that settles it."

"How about taking me along to take care of you?" Sue asked.

"Huh," Jack snorted.  "Anyone'd think we were a couple of babies."

"And I reckon we'd have to have a chaperon along if we took you," Bob
laughed.

"Well, of course, I didn't mean it, but just the same, I wish I was a
boy and then I could go," Sue pouted.

Mr. Stebbins, or Jeb as everyone called him, shook his head when they
showed him the letter.

"Your father has a lot of confidence in you for a fact and I'm not
saying that it's misplaced, but I can't help thinking that it's risky
for you two boys to go away off up there.  If Slats could go along
I'd feel better about it but, of course, that's out of the question.
Yes, I know your father wants you to go," he added as Bob was about
to speak, "and of course, the thing for you to do is to go only--"

Within an hour a wire was on its way to Mr. Lakewood, saying that
they were starting as soon as they could get ready.  Then followed a
busy time looking up routes and making reservations, to say nothing
of outfitting themselves with clothing suitable for wear in the far
North.

Slats Magee, just beginning to hobble around, on crutches, was loud
in his bewailment of the fate which kept him at home.

"If it was only an arm, now," he groaned.  "I'd put it in a sling an'
go anyhow."

They found that they could get a boat from Seattle on a Monday and as
that was only three days off, they were kept busy the most of the
time.  Finally the moment came to say good-bye and, as the train
pulled out from Cold Springs, Sue waved her hand from the platform
and shouted:

"Look out you don't fall in love with an Esquimo girl."

* * * * * * * * *

Hoping that the lifeboat might not have left the side of the ship the
boys laid the form of the captain on the deck and rushed to the rail.

"Too late," Jack cried as he pointed to a spot of light dancing up
and down some distance from the ship.

"Yes, they've gone all right," Bob agreed.

"What'll we do?"

"There must be another boat.  Didn't one of the mates say there were
others on the upper deck?"

"Yes, he said so, but do you suppose we can get it over in time?"

"We can try."

Rushing back to the head of the stairway they again picked the
captain up and a moment later were on the upper deck.  There they
were encouraged to find three lifeboats hanging from their davits
and, placing their burden gently down, they set about getting it
ready to lower.

"Hurry," Jack gasped as the boat gave a sickening lurch.  "She's
going in a minute or two."

Jack had quickly succeeded in getting his rope clear, but Bob was not
so fortunate.  His had gotten caught and it took him some time to get
it free.

"I'm doing the best I can," he panted pulling frantically at the
stiff rope.  "There, she's free.  Now you hold them while I drag him
over."

He handed his rope to Jack and rushed back a few feet for the
captain.  It was hard work getting him into the boat, but it was
finally accomplished and, springing in after him, they quickly began
to lower away.  As the boat touched the water a heavy wave dashed it
against the side of the ship and all but upset it, but Bob grabbed an
oar and succeeded in fending it off before the next wave hit them
and, a moment later, he was pulling on both oars with all his
strength.

They were not twenty feet away from the ship when a loud explosion
told them that the water had reached the boilers.

"Guess that'll finish her," Bob gasped.

Hardly had he spoken when the stern of the ship rose in the air and a
moment later the ill-fated ship slid beneath the waves.

"Good-bye, Majestic," Jack groaned.

Now that the danger from the suction, caused by the big ship, was
over, Bob rested on his oars and looked about him.  The sea was rough
and the lifeboat danced up and down, but he knew there was no danger
unless the wind increased in strength.  Far away he could see several
points of light which he knew marked the location of the other
lifeboats, but the boats themselves he could not see as heavy clouds
had obscured the moon.

"Guess we'd better pull toward them," he said as he again bent to the
oars.

"Let me take them," Jack suggested.

"You see if you can bring the captain around first.  I'm not tired
yet."

The form of the captain lay on the bottom of the boat at Jack's feet
and the boy slid from his seat and took his head in his lap.

"He's still breathing," he announced.

"Good.  Get some water on his head."

Under his ministrations the man soon sighed and, a moment later
opened his eyes.

"Where am I?" he whispered.

"You're safe," Jack replied.  "How do you feel?"

"I'll be all right in a minute.  The ship?  Did it--"

"Yes, she went down," Jack told him.

The captain closed his eyes and for a moment did not move.  Then he
again opened them and, in a much stronger voice, asked:

"How did I get in this boat?"

"Why, we put you in."

"But the others?"

"They're in another boat."

"They didn't wait?"

"No."

"Then how--"

"Better wait till you're a bit stronger, sir," Jack suggested as the
captain hesitated.

"I'm all right now," he insisted as he raised his head from the boy's
lap.

Seeing that he was determined to sit up Jack helped him to the seat
on which he had been sitting.

"Now suppose you tell me about it," he said.

"Well, there isn't much to tell," Jack began.  "When you didn't come
back we went to find you and--and found you."

"But where were the two mates?  Did they get back before you left?"

"Yes, sir."

"Well, why didn't they go?"

"I don't know, sir."

"Well, I guess I can see about the way it was and I guess I owe my
life to you two boys.  But, tell me, didn't they agree to wait till
you came back?"

"Well, they said they'd wait five minutes, but I guess we were
considerable longer than that," Jack told him.

"And they went off without you, eh?"

"I'm afraid they did, sir."

"I know it, but perhaps it's best not to judge them too harshly.  I
suppose a man has a right to save his own life."

"But what happened to you, sir?" Bob asked as he rested on his oars
for a moment.

"I must have fainted," the captain told them.  "You see I was subject
to fainting spells some years ago and had to give up the sea for
several years but, after I had gone five years without a single one,
I thought I was over them and persuaded the owners to let me have a
command again.  This was my first voyage," he groaned.  "But I
suppose the excitement and severe strain was responsible for the
relapse.  I shall never try it again."

"Do we seem to be getting any nearer the other boats?" Bob asked a
little later.

"It's hard to say," the captain replied.  "But I don't think we're
gaining much if any."

"Let me spell you now," Jack said as he rose from his seat.

While they had been talking the wind had been steadily rising and now
it was blowing almost a gale making it difficult to keep the boat's
head into the wind.

"Just a minute," Bob cried pulling strongly on his right oar.  "It
won't do to let her get broadside," he added as he moved over on his
seat to give Jack room.

It was a fortunate thing that they were used to boats else it is
doubtful if they would have been able to change places without
allowing the craft to wallow in the trough, but they finally
accomplished it and Bob was glad to rest his aching arms.

"Have you any idea how far we are from shore, sir?" he asked as soon
as he had settled himself in the seat beside the captain.

"A matter of twenty-five or thirty miles.  As you know we were about
twelve hours out, but we've been running not far from land."

In spite of his warm clothing Bob's teeth soon began to chatter as
the night was cold and he had been sweating from the violent exercise
of rowing.  Fortunately the captain had on his heavy coat and,
although he acknowledged that he was none too warm, he was not
shivering.

"What do you think of the weather, sir?" Bob asked a few minutes
later.

"I don't like it.  I'm afraid we'll have snow before morning."

As if to confirm his words Bob felt a snow flake strike his face.

"I'm afraid you're right, sir," he said.

The first flake was quickly followed by others and in less than ten
minutes they were flying thick and fast driven by the strong wind,
and so great was their velocity that they stung like needles as they
struck the skin.

"Getting tired, Jack?" Bob shouted.

"No, not yet," Jack called stoutly back.

"Well, I'm coming anyhow so move over.  There's no use in taking too
long shifts and, besides, I want to get warmed up a bit," he added as
he reached the seat by his brother's side.  "We've simply got to take
it as easy as we can for goodness knows how long we'll have to keep
this up."

The lights from the other boats had disappeared soon after it had
begun to snow and now there was nothing to be seen about them save
the swirling snow and the white foam of the water as the wind blew
off the tops of the waves.

"Wonder if there's anything to eat or drink in this boat," Jack said
as soon as he had reached his former seat beside the captain.

"There should be both food and water," the latter replied.  "All the
lifeboats are kept stocked in case of an emergency such as this."

"Where would it be?"

"Right back of you in the locker."

Jack turned half around and, reaching beneath the seat in the stern
lifted the cover of a small box fitted in the narrow space.  But it
was empty and, with a sinking heart, he turned back.

"Guess they forgot to stock this boat," he announced.

"You mean there's nothing there?"

"Not a thing."

"It's criminal negligence," the captain declared.  "It's the purser's
business to see that the lifeboats are kept stocked, but the fellow
we have is always neglecting his work, but, as he's some relative of
the owners it's been overlooked and now we've got to suffer for it."

The storm seemed to increase and Bob was having all he could do to
keep the boat head on.  He had lost all sense of direction and had no
idea whether he was rowing toward the shore or out to sea.  They were
running with the wind and he judged that they must be making several
miles an hour.

"It's my turn now," the captain shouted a few minutes after Jack had
discovered the lack of food and water.

Both boys protested against the move, but the man declared that he
was all right and well able to do his share of the work.

"Besides I need to get warmed up a bit," he added as he shifted his
position to the rower's seat.

"Looks like we might not get out of this scrape," Jack said in a low
tone as soon as Bob was seated beside him.

"Never say die," Bob replied hopefully.  "I've seen sicker cats than
this get well, and don't forget, Jack boy, that God can take care of
us just as well out here as He can on the land."

"I know it and, believe me, I've been asking Him to do that very
thing."

"So have I, and I believe He will."

The dismal night wore on.  At times the snow slackened until it had
almost ceased only to swirl down harder than ever a few minutes
later.  The wind kept about the same.  Every half hour they changed
shifts, as Jack called it, an arrangement which gave each an hour's
rest after a half hour of strenuous labor.  And each welcomed the
chance to row in spite of the hard work as he suffered with the cold
while resting.

"It'll be daylight in another hour," Bob announced as he moved to
Jack's side to take his shift.

"But I don't believe we'll be able to see much better than we can now
unless this snow lets up," Jack declared as he gave up the oars.

"Well, it can't keep on snowing forever," Bob added hopefully.

Just at that instant, as they were changing places, an extra strong
gust struck the boat and Bob, feeling the bow swing off, put all his
strength into his left oar in a desperate effort to straighten his
course.  Snap!  The oar broke like a pipe stem and the boat was
wallowing in the trough in an instant.  Almost instantly a huge wave
broke over it filling it half full of water and nearly throwing it
over.

"She'll go over in a minute," Bob shouted.

An instant later and his words proved true for the very next wave
caught the boat just right and over she went.



THE CABIN BY THE SHORE.

The water was icy cold and as Bob went beneath the surface it seemed
to him that his blood froze in his veins.  Thanks to the cork jacket
which he had kept on his head bobbed out of the water almost
immediately and, as he rose on the top of a wave, he looked about for
Jack, and saw him only a few feet away.

"Where's the captain?" he shouted.

"Don't know," Jack shouted back shaking the water from his eyes.

Both boys were expert swimmers and, with the help of the life
preservers, they had no difficulty in keeping afloat although the big
waves dashed over their heads filling their eyes with salt water.

"I'm afraid he's a goner," Bob gasped as he fought his way to his
brother's side.  "He didn't have on a preserver, you know."

"And I reckon we're goners too in spite of them," Jack chattered back.

Bob felt in his heart that Jack was right unless a miracle happened
as he well knew that no one could live long in that cold water which
seemed to penetrate to the very marrow of the bones.

"Swim hard so as to keep up the circulation," he began and then
paused as his eyes caught sight of something floating in the water
only a few feet to his right.  A few powerful strokes brought him to
the spot, but the object had disappeared.  With a prayer on his lips
he dove and swam downward with all his strength.  Down, down, he
struggled until he knew that he had reached his limit.  Then, just as
he was about to turn, his outstretched hand came in contact with
something and he knew he had found what he was after.  The memory of
that awful struggle to the surface haunted his dreams for months
afterward.  But, although it seemed as though his lungs would burst
with pressure and he more than once nearly lost his hold, he finally
succeeded and, to his great relief, he came up close beside Jack.

"Hold him a minute," he gasped.

As Jack relieved him he drank in great gulps of air and immediately
felt the strength pouring bade info his body.

"Is he dead?" Jack shouted.

"Don't know, but we must keep him up as long as we can."

"You bet."

Holding the form of the captain between them they fought the waves
striving to protect him from their fury as much as possible.  The
wind had swept the overturned boat far beyond their reach and they
knew it would be useless to try to reach it.

"I--I'm about all in," Jack gasped after they had fought but a few
minutes.

Bob knew that he himself was in about the same condition, but he
would not give up as long as an ounce of strength remained.

"Let me have him while you rest a bit," he said trying to keep his
teeth from chattering and the weakness from his voice.

"Not--much," he heard Jack murmur.

Bob did not have enough strength to insist and so they kept on until
it seemed he could not possibly take another stroke.  Was this to be
the end?

"I--I've got to--give--" he heard Jack cry but, at the same moment
his heart gave a great leap for his feet touched something and, the
next instant he was standing only waist deep in the water and helping
Jack to recover his footing while holding the captain's head above
water with one hand.

"Just in time," he encouraged his brother.

"I--I'll say--it was," Jack's teeth chattered so that he could hardly
speak.

Between them they managed to drag the unconscious form of the captain
through the shallow water to the shore, which was covered to a depth
of several inches, with snow.

"What are we going to do?" Jack panted as he looked about him.
"We'll all be frozen stiff in a few minutes if we stand here.
Suppose we can get a fire going?"

"I've got a waterproof box of matches somewhere but I'm afraid we'll
not be able to find anything that'll burn."

"Well we'd better--" Jack began and then uttered a cry of joy.
"There comes somebody," he shouted.

Through the gloom they could see a point of light swinging in such a
way that they knew someone was approaching with a lantern.

"This way, quick," Bob shouted, and, a moment later a tall, thickset
man stood beside them.

"Whar from you come, oui?" he asked.

"We were wrecked and--and, is there a house near?" Bob replied.

"Oui, ver' close by," the man told them and then, putting his hands
to his mouth shouted: "Hey Jacques, Pierre, come queek, queek."

It seemed that he had hardly called before an answering shout came
through the night and two forms, dimly seen at first, soon joined
them.

"You tak' heem to the house queek," the man ordered, and as the
others picked up the captain as though he was a child, he turned to
the boys.

"You think you walk heem?  Eet's just behind that bush clump."

"Sure, we're all right," Bob assured him as they started off through
the snow.

As they rounded the clump of bushes a good sized log cabin loomed
before them and, in another minute, they were inside in front of a
roaring fireplace.

"You geet dem wet things off queek now and tak' one bon rub with
deese towel," their benefactor ordered as he pulled a couple of
coarse, but clean towels from a chest.  "Dem boys dey look after
heem," he added nodding toward the other side of the fire where
Jacques and Pierre were already at work stripping the wet clothing
from the captain.

"Is--is he alive?" Bob asked.

"Oui, heem still breath some, but heem one mighty close call.  Mebby
heem geet well, mebby not.  Eet for the bon Dieu to say.  We do the
best we can."

"God must have sent you out to us," Jack declared rubbing his body
till it glowed.

"Oui, Le Dieu, heem tell me go out.  Me go."

A few minutes later wrapped in heavy blankets they were toasting
their feet in front of the fireplace and drinking hot coffee while
the captain, also wrapped in blankets, had been placed in one of the
bunks which lined one side of the cabin, after everything possible
had been done.  He was still unconscious and they knew that his life
hung in the balance.

"I never thought I'd be so warm again," Jack sighed contentedly as he
sipped his second dipper of hot coffee.

"Nor did I," Bob agreed.  "It was little short of a miracle.  But
what I can't understand is why there wasn't more surf where we came
ashore."

"That's so.  I never thought of it, but it does seem strange.  Maybe
we drifted into a cove or something."

"Reckon we must have."

"We'll ask one of the men when they come in," Jack said as he
listened to the sounds which came from a back room, which he supposed
was the kitchen and which indicated that they were getting a meal.

"Wonder what became of the other boats."

"They didn't come in where we did, that's sure."

"Maybe they were picked up."

"I hope so."

The faint light of the coming dawn was just beginning to steal in
through the window when, a little later, they heard a low moan from
the bunk where the captain had been laid.  Bob hurried across the
room, closely followed by Jack, and bent over the bed.  The captain's
eyes were open, but in them was no sign of recognition.

"Hard to the starboard," he muttered.  And then, "Starboard I said,
not port."

Bob laid his hand on the man's forehead and, as he expected, found it
very hot.

"He's burning up with fever," he told Jack.

"You--you think?"

"Pneumonia, most likely."

Just then the door opened and Pierre came in with the announcement
that breakfast was ready.

"The captain has recovered consciousness, but he's out of his head,"
Bob told him.

"Oui, we thot he would be.  Jacques, heem gone for doctor."

"How long will it take?"

"Eet tak' long time--too bad--eet thirty mile an heem have to walk,
but heem go ver' fast an' come back wid horse, mebby gas wagon."

"But he may die before he gets the doctor here."

"I think not.  We geeve heem medicine."

"Pray God he may live," Bob sighed.

"Oui, we pray.  Now you geet eats.  I watch heem."

Had food ever tasted so good as those baked beans and hot biscuit to
say nothing of the huge wedge of apple pie which followed?  Both boys
agreed that if it had they had forgotten when or where.

"If I eat another mouthful I'll burst," Bob declared as he pushed
back his chair.

"Well, I can still chew, but that's the limit.  There won't another
bit go down," Jack added.

Breakfast over they found that their clothes had dried and they were
soon, as Jack put it, clothed in their right minds once more.  The
three Frenchmen, they soon learned, were trappers and had lived here
for years as they were brothers and none had married.

The captain was raving as they came again info the big living room
and, at times, Pierre was having his hands full to hold him in the
bunk.

"Heem ver' bad, but heem got lots strength an' that bon sign," he
said as they approached.

"You think he'll pull through?" Bob asked anxiously.

"No can tell."  Pierre shook his head.

"Can we do anything?"

"Non.  I geeve him medicine, all we can do."

As they walked slowly around the clump of bushes and looked out over
the tumbling water they saw that their conjecture regarding the surf,
or rather the lack of it, had been correct.  A small cove, the points
of which were only a few yards apart, broke the violence of the
waves, making the water inside comparatively still.

"It's lucky we hit the opening," Bob said as he watched the rollers
come in and break outside the cove.

"I'll say it was.  I doubt if we could have gotten ashore outside
without having the life knocked out of us," Jack agreed.

"It's awful when you think what may have happened to the rest of
them," Bob said as they turned back.

"But they may have been picked up or got ashore all right."

"We'll hope so at any rate."

It was nearly two o'clock when the doctor came in a small touring car
with Jacques.  After a hasty examination he confirmed their fears
that it was pneumonia.

"Both lungs are congested," he told them.  "But his heart action is
strong and he's evidently lived a clean life, two very important
factors in a case of this kind."

"Then you think he has a chance?" Bob asked.

"Sure he has," the doctor assured him.  "But, of course, you never
can tell how pneumonia is going to turn out.  Much depends on the
nursing."

"Can we get a trained nurse?"

"You've got one."  The doctor nodded toward Pierre who had stepped
over to the fireplace.  "What that fellow doesn't know about nursing
hasn't yet been learned.  I'd rather have him than anyone I know."

"He was the captain of the steamer."

"Is that so?  How did it happen that you three were together?"

Bob told him the story of their escape.  "Did you hear anything of
any of the other boats?" he asked when he had finished.

"Yes, three of them came ashore about ten miles down the coast and
the others were picked up early this morning a few miles out."

"Then there were no deaths?"

"Not unless some of them die from the effects."

"It's good to know that," Bob assured him.

The doctor left an hour later promising to come again the next day
and somehow the boys felt encouraged although they realized that the
captain was a very sick man.

"We'll have to stay here till it goes one way or the other," Bob
whispered to Jack as the doctor drove off.

"Of course, unless we'll be in the way."

But Baptist, the older of the three brothers and the one who had
found them, assured them that so far from being in the way, they
could do much to help as they had their traps to see to.  So they
remained and did all they could to help about the place.  When the
doctor came the next day he found his patient about the same and told
them that in all probability there would not be much change for
another week at least.  When he left the boys asked him to take a
message to wire to their father and also to the ranch that they were
safe.

Day followed day with little or no change in the sick man.  Pierre
was untiring in his nursing and the boys soon found that the doctor's
praise had not been misplaced.  No woman could have been more tender
than was this rough appearing Frenchman.  Night and day he watched by
the bed of the stricken man leaving his post only long enough to
snatch a few hours' sleep each day.  At times the captain was in his
right mind for a few minutes and then he recognized them with a faint
smile of gratitude.  But for the most part he lay in a stupor.  Only
occasionally did he rave and then his mutterings were all of the sea.

Once his heart nearly stopped beating and Pierre thought, for a
moment that he was gone, but an injection of a powerful stimulant
brought him around.  Then, a few days later, came the crisis and the
two boys waited with bated breath while Pierre bent over the bunk
watching for the slightest sign of change.

"Queek.  The blankets," he shouted suddenly, and they grabbed from
before the fireplace the thick woolen blankets which had been hanging
there for several hours.

"Shut the windows," Pierre ordered as he snatched them from their
hands.

Quickly he wrapped the man in the warm folds and then sat with his
fingers on his pulse.

"Heem will live."  Pierre sprang to his feet as he made the
announcement and the boys never forgot the look on his face as he
closed his eyes.  They knew he was praying and they bowed their heads.

"See heem sweat."

Bending over the captain, who lay with closed eyes, they could see
the great drops of sweat on his forehead and knew that Pierre had
spoken the truth.  The fever was broken and, barring the unexpected,
the captain was on the road to recovery.

"Thank God," Bob breathed as they moved away.

"Amen," Jack added.

Great was the joy of Baptist and Jacques, when they returned from a
trip to their traps shortly before dark, to learn the good news.

"And it's all due to your nursing, Pierre," Bob declared.

"Non--non.  Le Bon Dieu, heem watch over heem," the Frenchman
insisted.

"Yes, he'll pull through all right now," the doctor said when he came
the following day.  "Didn't I tell you he was a good nurse?"

"He's the best ever," Bob assured him.

Another week and the captain was able to sit up though still very
weak.

"I owe my life twice to you boys," he said slowly as Bob pushed his
chair nearer to the fire.

"But most of all to Pierre," Bob reminded him.

"I know, and he shall have his reward if he will accept it.  I am not
a poor man by any means, but what do you think?  Can I offer him
money?"

"I don't think he would accept it?"

"Nor do I.  And yet I must do something.  What would you suggest?"

"Wait till you get home and then send them all a good present."

"I'll do it.  You don't find men like them very often."

It had been arranged that the boys were to leave the next day.  Now
that the captain was well out of danger they felt that they must not
delay longer and the doctor was to take them back to the little town
thirty miles down the coast, where they could get a train for Seattle.



THE BOYS START AGAIN FOR ALASKA.

"Well, we're off again."

It was two days after they had left the log cabin by the sea and the
steamer, on which they had, for the second time, engaged passage, was
drawing slowly away from the wharf.

"And here's hoping we have better luck than last time," Bob returned
and he leaned over the rail.  "But I might as well confess that I
feel a bit squeemish."

"But lightning never strikes twice in the same place you know," Jack
laughed.

"And, by the same token, I don't suppose we're likely to hit that
same derelict but there are others, you know," Bob smiled back.

"I know, but let's not borrow trouble."

"Pardon me, but are you Bob and Jack Lakewood?"

The boys turned quickly at the question and were much surprised to
see the captain of the ship standing before them.

"Yes, sir."

Both boys answered at the same time.

"I thought so," the captain smiled, holding out both hands which the
boys, although greatly puzzled, were quick to grasp.  "I am Richard
Blake and, as you have probably noted by my uniform, have the honor
to command this ship."

"Yes, we noticed it," Jack said as the captain paused.

"But you probably do not know that the man you saved is my brother."

"No, sir, we did not.  He told us that his name was Blake and that he
had a brother who was also a captain, but you do not look like him."
Bob smiled.

"That's true," the captain smiled back.  "Frank is light and small
while I am dark and rather above the average in size, but he's my
brother just the same and more than that he's the best brother a man
ever had."

"I can easily believe that, sir," Bob began and then stopped short.
"No, I don't either," he corrected.  "Make it as good a brother as a
man ever had and I won't say a word, but he can't be any better than
the one I've got."

The captain again reached out his hand and, as soon as Bob had
grasped if, said:

"That's one of the finest things I ever heard, and I'll accept the
suggestion.  Son," he added turning to Jack whose face was flushed,
"you also have a good brother so we might as well make it a trio."

"All I've got to say is that if you've got as good a brother as I
have you've got as good as they make," Jack grinned.

"I'm not going to try to thank you," the captain continued after a
moment's pause and both boys noticed that his eyes were dim with
tears.  "There are some things which are beyond thanks and--and I
know you know how I feel."

"Indeed we do, sir," Jack assured him.

"But, during this trip you are my guests.  I have already arranged
for you to sit at my table."

"That's very good of you, sir, and we certainly do appreciate it,"
Bob assured him.

"But please don't tell anyone about it," Jack begged.

"I won't," the captain smiled.

But in some way or other the truth leaked out and before the trip was
a day old they, much to their disgust, found themselves regarded as
heroes by crew and passengers alike.  But, in spite of it, the trip
proved most enjoyable.  The weather was perfect and the captain
seemed to take great delight in showing them the different parts of
the ship and in answering their many questions.  They, in turn, took
him into their confidence as to the object of their journey and he
expressed great surprise that their lather had sent them on such a
mission.

"Alaska is a mighty big place," he told them, "and in the winter it's
a very rough place let me tell you."

"You think it's dangerous: the trip up the Yukon, I mean?" Bob asked
him.

"Well, for you two boys to take such a trip at this time of the year
would be decidedly dangerous, not to say foolhardy, but if you get a
good native to go with you the risk will, of course, be much less."

"And do you think we can get one?"

"I guess there's little doubt about that provided you can afford it.
They charge a pretty stiff price these days."

"I'm sure father would want us to have a guide and will be willing to
pay whatever is right."

"Then by all means do it."

"Do you know of a man we can get?"

"Not personally, but I know a fellow up there who will know where to
get the right man and I'll attend to it."

"That's very good of you, and--"

"Good nothing," the captain interrupted.  "You forget what I owe you
two boys."

It was late in the afternoon when, a few days later, the ship steamed
up to her wharf at Nome.

"My, it's quite some city," Jack declared as he stood with Bob and
the captain in the pilot house.

"Largest in Alaska," the captain assured them.

"What's the population?" Bob asked.

"It was about 2,600 the last census and I guess it hasn't changed
much since."

The captain had invited them to remain on board as his guests while
the ship remained in port instead of going to a hotel and they had
been glad to accept the invitation.

"The ship will be here for three days and I won't have much to do so
we can put in the time together getting your outfit in shape," he
told them.

"That'll be fine if you can spare the time," Bob assured him.

"It'll keep me out of mischief," the man laughed.

"But don't you think it would be a good idea to see if we can find
someone who knew my uncle?  You see he was here for several weeks and
he must have gotten acquainted with somebody who would know something
about where he started for," Jack suggested.

"Of course, and I think I can name the very man to go to.  If he got
well acquainted with anyone here the chances are a hundred to one
that it was Pete Slinger.  Pete's a character, but a good reliable
man all the same.  I don't believe there's a man, woman or child in
Nome that doesn't know Pete well enough to call him by his first name
and as for Pete--well, he can tell you the life history of about
everyone who has spent upwards of two days in Nome during the past
ten years."

"Is he Irish?" Bob asked.

"Irish and French."

"What does he do?" Jack asked.

"Keeps a store and sells everything from tooth picks to second hand
pulpits."

"He ought to do some business," Bob remarked.

"He does.  He looks like a tramp, but I guess there's little doubt,
but that he's a got a good sized roll laid up against a rainy day.
We'll go and see him right after supper tonight."

As the three friends walked up the main street of the town that night
the boys were much surprised to find that it differed but little from
towns with which they were familiar in the northern part of Maine.
Except for an occasional Esquimo the people also seemed much the same
being largely French Canadians with a liberal sprinkling of Americans.

"Gee, I expected to see polar bears running about the streets," Jack
laughed.

"And reindeer pulling the pungs I suppose," the captain added.

"Sure thing," Jack assured him whereat they all laughed.

"Well, here we are," the captain said as they stopped in front of one
of the largest buildings on the street.  "This is Pete's place."

There were several men and two or three women in the store as they
entered, but no sooner did the proprietor catch sight of the captain
than he dropped a sugar scoop back in the barrel and, pushing his
customers right and left, came rushing up.

"Faith an' yer a sight fer sore eyes so yer be," he cried as he
grasped the captain's hands in both of his.

"And, believe me, I'm glad to see you again," the captain laughed.
"But I want you to meet my two friends, Bob and Jack Lakewood."

The Irishman, a small man standing not over five feet two or three
inches and weighing less than a hundred and twenty pounds, looked at
the two boys for a full minute before speaking.

"Don't be after tellin' me thot they're the byes what saved Frank,"
he said at last.

"But they are," the captain assured him.

Without a word the small man threw his arms about Bob's neck and gave
him a hearty hug at the same time kissing him on both cheeks.  Then,
releasing him he gave Jack the same treatment.

"The store's yer's, the house's yer's, bless me heart the whale
blamed town's yer's, yes wid all uv Canada throwed in," he cried.
Then turning to the people who were standing looking wonderingly on,
he shouted: "Did yer hear ut?  These be the byes whot saved Cap'n
Frank whin his ship went down.  What yer standin' thar fer loike a
lot uv dummies?  Come up here forninst and shake hands wid 'em ivery
mother's son uv yer."

The people needed no second invitation and in another moment the boys
were busy shaking hands and murmuring their thanks.

"Now git out uv here all uv yees an' let me talk wid me friends," the
storekeeper ordered and the boys were amazed at the meekness and
celerity with which the order was obeyed.

"Don't let us interfere with your business," Bob said.

"Interfere nuttin'.  They'll all be back inside an hour," the man
assured him as he led the way back to one corner of the store which
was fitted up as an office.  "Sit down wid yer an' tell me all about
it," he ordered.

Bob gave him an account of the wreck keeping himself and Jack out of
it as much as he could and when he had finished the storekeeper
turned to Captain Blake and said:

"'Tis modest they are as well as brave an' thot's a mighty good
combination let me tell yer.  I've heard uv thim Canucks down toward
Seattle whot took Frank an' the byes in but I've niver seen 'em.
Believe me, they're goin' ter git a good presint from old Pete.
Can't yer see I'm busy the minute?"  This last was shouted at a man
who had just come in the store and was noisily drumming on the
counter in an effort to attract attention.  Without a word he turned
and went out.

"You've sure got your customers well trained, Pete," the captain
smiled.

"They know better'n ter fool wid me," Pete grinned.  "Jerry's sick
wid a bad cold an' it laves me all alone in the store," he explained.
"By the way," he added as though with a sudden thought, "I wonder if
you bye's are related iny ter a man what was here a few weeks ago..
His name was the same as yourn, front name was Silas, Silas Lakewood."

"He is our uncle," Bob told him.  "And we've come up here to find
him.  Did you know him?"

"I did thot.  He used ter come in a lot an' chin wid me an' a mighty
interstin' chinner he was too, let me tell yer.  Guess he'd bin about
all over the world."

"Yes, Uncle Silas was a great traveler and the funny part of it is
that we've never seen him."

"Is thot so?  It do seem strange.  He's a kinder queer loike feller
too: didn't seem half the time ter know jest what he did want, but
allys seemed ter be wantin' sumpin'."

"Did you know he was going up the Yukon with a man by the name of
Long?" Bob asked anxiously.

"Yep, he told me all about it a few days afore he left an' I did all
I could ter keep him from goin'."

"Why was that?"

"Cause I didn't trust thot man, Long, what was a goin' wid him, not
none I didn't.  But his mind was made up and thar was no sech thing
as changin' him.  He thought Long was all thot he made hisself out
ter be an' yer couldn't say a word agin him."

"But do you know where they were going?  He wrote father that they
would be gone only a month."

"An' he told me the same thing an' here he's been gone, let me see,
it must be most three months.  He told me thot they were goin' up the
Yukon as fer as whar the Koynkuk empties inter it an' thin they were
goin' ter follow thot river up a piece, but he didn't say jest how
fer."

"How far is the Koynkuk from here?" Bob asked,

"Matter uv 250 or 300 miles more or less."

"And he only expected to take a month for the trip.  It seems to me
that that wouldn't leave them much time to prospect after they got up
there."

"Jest whot I told him, but he said Long said they could do ut in thot
time an' he sure did trust thot man worse luck."

"What's the score against Long?" Captain Blake asked.

"I dunno thar's anything agin him thot yer could lay yer finger on,
but he's kinder slippery loike an eel an' I niver did cotton ter him.
He may be all right, but I'm bettin' he ain't."

"Did they take a good store of supplies with them?" Jack asked.

"'Bout enough fer a month I should say."

"Well, Pete," Captain Blake said after a short pause, "the boys want
to go after him and it's up to you to get them a good guide, a man
you can trust."

"Sure an' it's meself as knows jest the man if he's at home.  I
haven't seen him fer two or three days, but he's prob'ly round
somewhars.  Yer sit here a minute an' I'll find out."

Pete left the store by the front door and was gone about ten minutes.

"Lucky Hogan'll be here in a few minutes," he announced when he
returned.  "He's in town an' it's three men I sent ter find him."

"He's Irish?" Captain Blake asked.

Pete laughed.  "Thot's the funny part uv it.  Thar's not a drop uv
Irish blood in him: he's pure Injun: a full blooded Crow."

"Then that isn't his real name?"

"I dunno.  S'pose not, but it's what iveryone calls him."

"He's reliable?"

"Yer don't s'pose I'd sent fer him if he wasn't do yer?" Pete replied
a bit nettled.

"Of course not," the captain hastened to assure him.  "I just asked
the question without thinking."

"I'd trust Lucky wid me own life an' so would anyone else what knows
him," Pete affirmed.

"And you think he'll go?" Bob asked.

"Sure, but yer'll have ter pay him five dollars a day.

"We'll be glad to," Bob assured him.

"Why do they call him Lucky?" Jack asked.

"I dunno.  He niver's had iny great luck not's fer's I know."

"I suppose you can fit them out all right, Pete?" Captain Blake asked.

"Lave ut ter me.  Whin do you want ter start?" he asked, turning to
Bob.

"Why, the sooner the better, I suppose.  Let's see, today's Friday.
Do you think we could get off on Monday?"

"Nuthin' ter prevent fur's I can see."

"Is the Yukon froze over yet?" Jack asked.

"Sure it is wid five or six inches uv ice on it.  If it wasn't fer
the snow yer could make foine time on skates, but thar's apt ter be a
big snow storm iny time now."

"How cold do you boys think it is now?" the captain asked.

"Must be pretty near down to freezing," Jack replied.

Pete laughed.

"Did you notice the thermometer when you went out?" the captain asked.

"Ut was ten below."

"You mean below zero?" Jack asked doubtfully.

"Sure I do."

"Well, it doesn't seem possible.  It must be mighty dry up here.  It
would seem colder than this at that temperature in Maine and it's
pretty dry there."

"Wait till it gets fifty below thin yer'll know it's cold," Pete
laughed.

"We've seen it forty below in Maine," Bob told him.

Just then the front door opened and a man stepped in and, after
looking about for a moment, came over toward the office.  That he was
an Indian there could be little doubt.  Tall and straight as an arrow
his coal black hair and piercing black eyes gave to him a dignity
which at once caught their attention.  At the same time there was
that about the man which inspired trust and this they both felt
instinctively.

"Sam say you want see Injun heap queek," he said as he stood before
them.

"An' Sam said jest right, begorra.  Lucky, this is Cap'n Blake,
you've prob'ly seen him, but yer niver saw these two byes afore an' I
want yer should understand as how they're particular friends uv mine.
They saved Cap'n Frank's life that's what they did."

Both boys had risen from their chairs as Pete started his
introduction and now they both held out their hand with a smile.

"Injun heap glad know friends of Pete's an' Cap'n Frank, heem heap
fine man.  Injun know heem long time.  Heem good to Injun."

"Now I remember hearing Frank speak of you," the captain said as he
in turn shook the Indian's hand.  "It seems rather strange that I've
never met you before."

"Cap'n Frank, your brother?" the Indian asked.

"Yes, but we don't look much alike."

"You heap bigger."

"And darker too," the captain added.

"Sot yerself, Lucky, an' it's meself as'll tell yer what we want,"
Pete said and explained the situation to him.  "You can go, eh?" he
asked when he had finished.

"Oui, Injun go if Pete wants," he said without hesitation.

"I'd rather trust these byes ter you than ter iny man I know," Pete
said and the boys could see that the Indian was pleased at the
compliment although he tried not to show it.  "Your dogs in good
shape?" he asked.

"They all right."

"Good.  Then you be ready ter start Monday morning."

"Injun be ready."

"I'll bet he's a fine fellow," Jack declared as soon as the Indian
had left the store.

"Yer can tie ter him," Pete assured them.

"He inspires trust," Bob added.

"He sure deserves ut too."

"Well, Pete, we won't keep your trade away any longer," the captain
said as he got up from his chair.

"Thar's no need ter hurry," Pete told them.

"Come on board and take dinner with us tomorrow," the captain invited.

"What time?"

"We dine at one o'clock."

"Faith an' I'll be thar wid bells on.  Have ter close up store, but
thot don't matter iny."

"It is a bit cold," Jack said when they were half way back to the
ship.

They had stopped at the telegraph office long enough to permit the
boys to send a wire to their father telling of their safe arrival and
that they had secured a good guide.

"What a man that storekeeper is," Bob remarked as they walked along.

"I told you he was a character," the captain smiled.

"And that Indian," Jack added.  "He may be a Crow, but here's betting
that he's a man and a mighty good one."

"If Pete recommends a man you can bank on it that he's all right,"
the captain assured them.  "As I said awhile ago I remember hearing
Frank speak of him as one of the most trustworthy Indians he had ever
met."

"Then I reckon we'll be safe with him," Bob declared.

"As safe as you could be with anyone," the captain said soberly.



OFF FOR THE NORTH.

Monday morning dawned bright and clear with the temperature fifteen
below zero.  Late Saturday night and nearly all day Sunday it had
snowed and nearly eighteen inches were added to the little which had
covered the ground when they had landed.  The intervening days had
been busy ones.  What with getting everything in readiness for the
start and spending as much time as was possible with Captain Blake,
who seemed loath to let them out of his sight, their time had been
fully occupied.  They had seen much of Pete Slinger and had come to
love the little Irishman.  And not only that, but their respect for
him grew by leaps and bounds as they had frequent exhibitions of his
wonderful ability along many lines.

"I wonder if there's anything he can't do," Jack said after he had
seen him put a barrel of flour on to his shoulder with apparent ease.

"I don't know what it is if there is," the captain told him.

Pete, on his side, fairly seemed to worship the boys and there was
nothing too much for him to do for them.

The ship was to sail at noon that day and Captain Blake had said the
night before that he was glad as the place would seem very lonesome
to him after they had gone.

It was only a few minutes after seven o'clock and still dark when
they reached the store.  As they approached they saw a long narrow
sled loaded nearly three feet high with all sorts of packages.
Hitched single file to it were six dogs who growled ominously as they
came up.

"Lucky's on time all right," the captain said as he mounted the steps.

"Those dogs don't seem very much pleased to see us," Jack declared as
he followed close at his heels.

"I guess they'll be all right when they get acquainted," Bob said.

"Here yees are," Pete greeted them as the captain pushed open the
door.  "I was jest tellin' Lucky thot he'd have ter go an' pull yees
out uv bed."

Everything was all ready for the start and the good byes were quickly
said.  Outside once more Lucky grasped one of the handles, which
stuck out breast high at the rear of the sled, with one hand while
with the other he swung the long raw hide whip which cracked with a
report like that of a forty-five.

"Mush," he ordered and the dogs started off up the street while the
boys fell in behind.

"Good bye an' good luck to yees," Pete shouted.

"God keep you," the captain called after them.

"Good bye, good bye," the boys called back.

Lucky Hogan had explained the night before that they were to cut
across country for a distance of some 250 miles where they would
strike the river at about the same distance from the coast.  As they
left the town the stars above were just beginning to pale while in
the east a faint glow told of the coming day.

"If I go too fast let me know heap soon," Lucky called back over his
shoulder.

"We will that," Jack assured him.

Although they had started fairly early several teams had left ahead
of them and the trail was in fairly good shape.  Nevertheless it was
hard traveling from the start.  The snow was light and dry and the
footing anything but secure, and inside of an hour they were both
puffing hard.

"That fellow must think we're used to this all right," Jack panted,
glancing back over his shoulder at Bob who was a few feet behind.

"Tell him he'll have to slow up a bit," Bob suggested.

The Indian stopped the team as soon as Jack called to him and waited
for them to catch up.

"We go too fast, eh?" he asked.

"Just a little," Jack told him.  "You see, we're a bit soft and it'll
take a few miles to get our muscles hardened up."

"Injun try remember, go slower," he promised.

"Hope he doesn't think we're lazy," Bob whispered as Lucky started up
the dogs again after allowing them to rest for a few minutes.

About nine o'clock the sun came up and it began to warm up a little
and soon the boys were forced to discard their heavy mackinaws.  The
country, through which they were passing, was hilly and Jack declared
that they were going either up hill or down all the time and he was
not far wrong.  About every hour the Indian stopped the team and
allowed the dogs to rest for some ten minutes and the boys were glad
of the breathing spells.

When noon came they halted at the foot of a long steep hill and ate
their lunch which Pete had provided, washing it down with hot coffee
from a thermos bottle.

"How far have we come?" Jack asked.

"'Bout twenty mile," the Indian told him.

"Gee, is that all?"

"No mak' fast time in deep snow."

"Well, we've been going fast enough to suit me," Bob laughed.

"Same here," Jack added.

The Indian, before eating, had fed the dogs, giving each a frozen
fish, and they were now lying in the snow.  Jack, as soon as he had
finished, went toward them thinking that it would be a good time to
get acquainted.  But an ominous growl caused him to stop and look
back inquiringly.

"Better wait," the Indian cautioned him and he came back.  "Them dog
heap bad when them no know you.  Them know you ver' soon then you
touch um," he explained.

"Would they bite me now?"

"Plenty apt bite now, not after while."

"Then I reckon I'll wait," Jack grinned as he sat down on the snow
beside the trail.  "But, I say, Lucky, they look like fine dogs."

"Them heap best dogs ever was," the Indian replied proudly.  "They
all one litter, oui.  Injun had der father an' mother, raise um."

"How old are they?" Bob asked.

"Two year come summer."

"They're little more that pups then?"

"But they ver' strong and heap fast."

"I'll bet they are," Jack agreed.

"That lead dog heem Lightning an' next Thunder," the Indian told them.

"Those are good names," Bob said.  "What do you call the others?"

"Next one Pete, den Kish, den Slack an' der sled dog heem Jim."

"Did you name that one after Pete Slinger?" Jack asked.

"Oui, heem bon friend to Injun an' Pete heem ver 'bon dog."

"But how about Slack?  Why do you call him that?" Bob asked.

"Heem lazy, heem strong like moose, but heem lik' hang back.  Call
heem Slack."

"What breed are they?"

"Mother was Esquimo dog, heap beeg girl an' father heem timber wolf."

"You mean they're half wolf?"

"Oui."

"But where did you get him?"

"Injun catch um when ver' leetle pup."

"But I always thought you couldn't tame a wolf," Jack broke in.

"No geet ver' fame, but heem know Injun, no other man touch heem,
jest Injun."

"Have you got them now?" Jack asked.

"No got.  Heem break chain one night, go off an' no come back.  Mebby
geet shot.  She geet seek ver' soon an' die, seex moons gone."

They had met no one all morning, but they were only about half way up
the hill when, almost without warning, a team swept around a bend in
the trail.  Coming down the hill they were traveling fast and, before
Lucky could get his team out of the way, the two leaders had met.
The boys were some thirty feet behind the sled and by the time they
reached the scene of action the air seemed, as Jack afterward
declared, full of dogs.  The yelps and growls of the combatants
drowned the voices of the Indian and the driver of the other team as
they shouted orders to which the dogs paid not the slightest
attention.  There were six dogs in the other team and, for a moment,
they seemed well matched so far as the boys could see, but soon even
they could tell that the strangers were getting far the worst of it.

"Our dogs'll kill them," Bob shouted.

But the fight was over almost as quickly as it had started.  The
stranger's dogs, evidently realizing that they were outclassed, soon
gave up the combat and shrank back whining piteously.  Lucky's dogs
did not press their advantage being apparently satisfied with the
result.  But the driver of the beaten team did not show as good
judgment.  He was a large burly man whose dark skin and high cheek
bones indicated that he was a half breed.  No sooner had the dogs
separated than, with a snarl of rage, he drew an ugly looking
revolver from his belt and aimed it at Lightning.

"Don't shoot him," Jack gasped.

Then an amazing thing took place.  Lucky was about twelve feet from
the breed when the latter drew his gun and, with a movement of his
arm incredibly swift, his whip lash darted out and the end wrapped
itself about the barrel of the revolver.  Another quick movement and
the gun was snatched from the man's hand and sent flying through the
air to fall in the snow twenty feet away.  The entire scene took
place so swiftly that it was all over before the boys realized what
had happened.

"Did you see that?" Bob gasped.

But before Jack could answer the breed had leaped for the Indian with
a hoarse cry of rage.  The boys held their breath wondering what was
coming next, but they did not have long to wait.  They had suspected
that the Indian was possessed of great strength, but what they saw
amazed them.  As the breed rushed toward him the Indian bent his body
slightly to meet the attack and the next instant they saw the
stranger lifted bodily and thrown several feet to fall sprawling in
the snow.

"How'd he do it?" Jack whispered.

"He did it all right," Bob replied.  "Wonder if he's had enough."

The breed was slowly picking himself up a look of blank amazement on
his face.  First he looked toward the boys and then turned to Lucky
who stood with a look of calm stoicism on his face.

"Better not," he said calmly as the breed took a step toward him.

There was something in the Indian's voice that gave the other pause
for he stopped and, for a moment stood as though undecided what to
do.  Then he turned and started toward where the revolver had fallen.

"Stop."

At the order the breed turned his head but kept on.

"Stop."

This time he halted and growled:

"I'm goin' ter geet my gun."

"Injun geet eet," and he sprang from the trail and a moment later
picked the revolver from where it had fallen in the snow.

Removing the cartridges he threw them away and then, stepping close
to the breed, handed him the gun.  For a second it seemed that the
breed was about to jump at the Indian's throat in spite of the lesson
he had already received, but he evidently thought better of it for he
snatched the gun from his hand and, thrusting it into his belt,
turned and went quickly back to where his dogs were lying in the
snow.  Lucky followed and at his command his dogs rose and soon, with
the help of the boys, the team was out of the trail enough to permit
the other team to pass.  Low rumbling growls came from the throats of
the dogs of both teams as they passed, but there was no move toward
another attack.

"Do you know that fellow?" Bob asked as soon as the stranger had
gotten out of hearing.

"Non, heem heap bad man."

"He's a heap disagreeable one," Jack added.

"But he tackled the wrong customer when he tackled you," Bob said
with an admiring glance at Lucky.  "That was the prettiest throw I
ever saw: wish you would teach me how to do it."

"Oui, Injun show white boy sometime."

Lucky examined the harness, but found it had not been injured during
the fight and, at his cry of "mush" the dogs were off again.

"My, what a man," Bob said in a low tone as he and Jack fell in
behind.

"And then some," Jack added.

"It seems queer," Bob continued.

"What seems queer?"

"Why, Lucky."

"But what do you mean queer?"

"Well, he looks like an Indian and he acts like an Indian and we have
it from no less authority than the great Pete Slinger that he is an
Indian, but he talks like a Canuck and has an Irish name.  Can you
beat it?"

"But he says heap once in a while and just a minute ago he referred
to you as a white boy.  That's Indian all right."

At last they reached the top of the long hill and the trail dipped
down on the other side in an almost endless reach.  It was four
o'clock when they reached the edge of a thick growth of trees and, as
it was nearly dark, Lucky proposed that they make camp for the night.
Both boys greeted the suggestion eagerly for, although they would
hesitate to acknowledge it, they were tired.  Beneath the broad
branches of a giant spruce, which stood just within the edge of the
forest, the ground was nearly bare of snow and Lucky choose it as a
good place.

"White boys cut plenty boughs while Indian unpack stuff," he
suggested as he pulled two small, but sharp axes from beneath the
canvas which covered the load.

By the time they had enough of the fragrant boughs cut to satisfy
him, the Indian had the dogs fed and fixed for the night, what they
needed unpacked and a fire started.

"Talk about efficiency," Jack declared as he brought in his third
armful of boughs.

"He's it," Bob laughed.

"Hope he's as good a cook as he is at other things," Jack whispered.

"It'll be funny if he isn't."

"You mean it'll be a tragedy."

But their fears were groundless for in less than an hour from the
time they had reached the woods the Indian announced that supper was
ready.  Venison steak and potatoes baked in the camp fire constituted
the main part of the meal and both boys declared that nothing had
ever fasted better.  The Indian seemed pleased at their words of
praise and urged them to eat until both declared that they could not
get another mouthful down.  They washed the dishes in melted snow
water which had been heating in a large iron kettle set in the hot
ashes.

It was now pitch dark and a light wind had sprung up during the last
half hour.

"You think it's going to storm?" Bob asked a little later as they sat
by the fire.

"Oui, Injun 'fraid so."

The wind had been increasing slowly, but steadily and now the moan of
the trees, as their tops swayed to and fro, filled the night.  For an
hour or more they sat by the fire while, at Bob's invitation, the
Indian entertained them with stories of his early life.  He was a
good story teller and they listened with bated breath as he told of
one adventure after another.

"Time to sleep now," he finally declared.

"I reckon," Bob agreed.

"You think it'll snow before morning?" Jack asked as he got to his
feet.

The Indian hesitated a moment.  "Wind getting round Nor East, mean
snow," he finally declared.

From the sled, which had been left beneath the branches of another
spruce near by, he brought three sleeping bags, huge canvas affairs,
lined with bear skins and fitted with a flap, which could be drawn
completely over the head, but which was equipped with air holes so
that the sleeper would be able to breath easily.

"We ought to sleep warm in those things," Jack declared.

"Oui, sleep heap warm," Lucky assured them.

How long he had been asleep Bob did not know but, sometime in the
night, he awakened with a sudden start.  For an instant he wondered
where he was and then, as memory returned, he wondered what had
disturbed him for he rarely woke up in the night unless there was a
cause.  But, after listening intently for a moment and hearing
nothing save the sighing of the trees and an occasional low growl
from one of the dogs, he decided that he had been mistaken and was
about to go to sleep again when, far off in the forest, he heard a
low but distinct howl.

"That sounds like a wolf," he thought.

And then, from a direction more to the right, came an answering howl
a little louder than the other.

He was lying close to Jack who was between him and the Indian and, as
the second howl rang through the forest, he felt his brother stir.

"Did you hear it?" He asked.

"Sure did."

"Sounded like a wolf."

"That's what I thought."

Then came the answer from the first wolf and now it was apparently
much nearer.  Low menacing growls from the dogs indicated that they
too had heard the ominous sounds.

"They're coming this way," Jack declared.

"Sounds like it."

"Think there's any danger?"

"Injun build up fire.  No come ver' near fire."

So Lucky also was awake.  Bob had thought it a bit strange that the
Indian had not been awakened as he knew that most forest bred men
were light sleepers.

"Can we help?" he asked as he heard him crawling out from his
sleeping bag.

"Non.  Plenty much wood.  Injun feex heem."

The fire, as Bob could see from where he lay, had not entirely died
out and, as Lucky had said, there was plenty of wood, and soon it was
blazing up brightly the fight casting weird shadows.

"Wolf no come near fire," the Indian told them as he crawled back
into his bag.

"What time is it?  Did you look?" Bob asked.

"Oui, three o'clock."

"Will that fire last till morning?"

"Injun keep heem feexed.  White boys go sleep," he assured them.

"Is it snowing?" Jack asked.

"Oui, heem snow leetle, not hard--yet."

As they could tell by the sound of the howls the wolves were coming
nearer and, in spite of the Indian's assurance, the boys were unable
to go to sleep again.

"That fellow wasn't far off," Jack whispered a few minutes later.

"Neither was that one," Bob replied.

"Hope they know that they're supposed to be afraid of fire."

"Same here."

The dogs were getting more and more uneasy as the wolves came closer
and soon the boys heard the Indian again moving.  He threw some more
wood on the fire and then, going to where the dogs were stationed, he
spoke to them in a low tone as if fearful that he would awaken the
boys.  At his words the dogs ceased their growls, but a low whining
told that they were not fully reassured.

"We're not asleep," Bob called out.

"How many of them are there should you say?" Jack asked as the Indian
came back beneath the tree.

"Mebby ten, mebby more."

Howl now answered howl in rapid succession as the wolves came nearer
and, a few minutes later Bob, who was sitting up, thought he could
see a shadowy form on the other side of the fire and some twenty feet
away from it.

"Look, Jack," he whispered.

"I can't see anything."

"Just the other side of that big tree."

"I see it now."

"Heem no come nearer," the Indian assured him.

"How about trying a shot at him?" Bob whispered.

But before he could get out of his bag at his automatic, which was in
his belt, the wolf had disappeared.

"He saved his hide," Jack said.

That the roaring fire had been too much for the wolves to face was
evident as their howls grew; fainter and fainter and finally died out
altogether.

"I'm mighty glad they were educated wolves," Jack sighed as he
snuggled down in his bag.

"What you mean, educated?" Bob asked him.

"Why, that they were brought up to be afraid of fire."



A NORTHERN BLIZZARD.

It was still dark when Bob awoke again, but the smell of frying
bacon, which came to his nostrils as he raised his head, told him
that it was morning and time to get up.  The wind was blowing hard as
he could tell by the sound of the tree tops and a fine snow was
drifting in even beneath the tree and he saw that both Jack and
himself were nearly buried in it.

"Time to get up," he said giving his brother a shake.

"Huh."

"I said it's time to get up," Bob repeated.

"Oh, all right," and in another minute Jack had wiggled out of his
bag.  "Gee, it's storming all right, isn't it?"

"I'll say it is.  Hear that wind."

"Heap beeg snow outside," Lucky declared as they came close to the
fire.

"It must be coming down pretty fast," Bob agreed as he noticed that
even in the thick woods several inches had fallen.

"Will it last all day?" Bob asked.

"Mebby."

"But we can keep on just the same?"

"Oui, in the woods heem not so bad."

"How long'll we be in the woods?" Jack asked.

"Fifty, seexty mile."

"Then we won't be out today, that's certain."

It was eight o'clock when they started and still dark.  The going was
much harder than the day before as the newly fallen snow made the
footing even more insecure.

"We'll be lucky if we make twenty miles today," Bob told Jack before
they had gone a mile.

Although the thick trees sheltered them to a large extent from the
fury of the storm, which had now nearly assumed the proportions of a
blizzard, yet the sharp particles of snow stung their faces like
needles whenever an open space allowed the wind to reach them with
anything like its full force.  The snow was also getting deeper and
deeper and for the last half mile the Indian had been breaking trail
ahead of the team.

"It must be fierce out in the open," Jack declared as they paused for
a rest shortly after nine o'clock.

"Heem heap bad," Lucky agreed.

"And it seems to be getting worse instead of better," Bob added as he
glanced up through an open space between the trees.

"It's sure howling some," Jack agreed.

"I think you better put on snow-shoe now," Lucky advised as they were
about to start off again.  "White boys know um?"

"You bet," Bob assured him.  "We were raised in Maine you know and,
believe me, they have some snow up there."

"But you can't break trail with snow-shoes on," Jack objected.

"Non, no can.  Injun no put um on."

"Then we're going to take turns at it," Bob declared.

"Injun break trail."

"Not now, he won't," Bob insisted shaking his head as Lucky held out
a pair of snow-shoes which he had taken from the pack on the sled.
"You put them on, I'm going to break trail for awhile."

"But Injun--"

"I know, you'd do all the work if we'd let you, but we're going to do
our share," Bob insisted.

Seeing that the boy was determined the Indian did not insist further,
but thrust his feet into the straps and motioned Bob to go ahead.
There was still enough of the trail left so that he had no trouble in
keeping the path, but it was filling rapidly and in places the snow
was already drifted even across it.  He had expected to find it hard
work, but it was harder than he had thought it would be.  But he was
strong and not afraid of hard work so he kept at it until Jack sang
out that it was his turn.

"It's getting pretty hard to see the trail and you'll have to be
careful," he advised as he slipped his feet into the shoes which Jack
had been wearing.

"Injun know heem get off trail," Lucky assured them.

Bob judged that they had been making about two miles an hour and the
Indian agreed with him when he mentioned it.

"And I reckon we'll go slower before we go faster," Jack said.  "Just
listen to that wind."

"Do you suppose those wolves are following us?" Bob asked the Indian
a few minutes later.

"Mebby."

"I thought I heard one howl just then, but perhaps it was only the
wind."

"Injun hear heem."

"Are they timber wolves?"

"Oui."

"Will they attack a man?"

"Mebby."

"But not likely?"

"Them geet a man alone them go for heem, not likely three mans."

Bob was not frightened, but he always liked to know just what he was
up against and he had read so many stories in which wolves, and
especially timber wolves, had attacked men that he was a bit worried.

"I suppose one could get up in a tree if they should attack us," he
suggested.

"Oui, but them no geet us," the Indian assured him.

At noon they halted in a sheltered place for dinner and several times
while eating they heard the howls of the wolves, but they were at
some distance and the Indian assured them that there was no danger.

During the afternoon the storm increased in violence but they kept
steadily on breaking trail by turns in short shifts.  The old tracks
had disappeared sometime ago and the Indian was obliged to
continually shout directions when either of the boys were in the
lead.  In spite of the fact that one or the other always went ahead
of the dogs it was hard work for them to drag the sled along and at
three o'clock Lucky decided that they had better call it a day.

"Them dog heem ver' tired," he said.

"And it's no wonder," Bob agreed.

"They got nothing on me at that," Jack declared.

Although still early in the afternoon dusk was already beginning to
creep over the forest and they knew that it would be dark in another
hour.

As on the previous day the boys cut boughs for the beds while the
Indian attended to the dogs and started the fire.

"We geet heap plenty wood," he told them as soon as they had brought
in enough boughs.  "Fire burn plenty fast in wind."

"You bet we want plenty," Jack agreed.

"Enough to entertain all comers," Bob added.

"We'll get it while you're getting supper," Jack told him and the
Indian nodded assent.

But it was not so easy to keep his promise as he had thought.  The
snow was now so deep that all the dead underbrush was buried out of
sight and the darkness was rapidly increasing.

"Looks kind of dubious," Jack said after they had been hunting for
several minutes.

"I'll say it does, but we've got to find some and that's all there is
to it," Bob replied.  "I don't want those wolves nibbling at my toes
tonight."

"I reckon they'd nibble more than your toes if they got that close,"
Jack declared.  "But here's what we want so I guess your tootsies are
safe."

He had found a dead tree almost ready to fall over and, as he spoke
he gave it a shove and down it came.

"If it hasn't all gone to punk," Bob said as he came up.

A quick examination proved that, although the tree had been dead for
some time, it was still fit for firewood and they set to work to cut
it up so that they could drag it to the camp some fifty feet away.

"Think this one'll be enough?" Jack asked as he started off with the
butt.

"I don't know, but we'd better get more if we can."

But by the time they had dragged the different parts of the tree up
to where Lucky had started a fire with some dead branches which he
had found close by, he told them that they had enough.

"You sure?" Bob asked anxiously.

"I think so but mebby you find one more."

"Come on, Jack," Bob said as he started back.  "I think I saw another
dead one close by that one."

It was now so dark that they could see but a few feet ahead of them
and they were obliged to be very careful with the axes to avoid an
accident, but they finally got the other tree cut up and dragged into
camp.

"Now I feel better," Bob declared.

"Supper heem ready," came the welcome announcement just as they were
putting away the axes.

All that night the storm raged.  Several times during the night they
heard the howls of wolves above the noise of the storm, but they did
not come very near thanks undoubtedly to the fire which the Indian
kept burning brightly all the time.  It was eight o'clock when Lucky
awoke them to find that the storm had nearly blown itself out and
that breakfast was ready.  Over a foot more of snow had fallen and
they knew that their progress would be slow that day.

"It's almost as bad as the case of the frog jumping out of the well,"
Jack declared as he poured himself a cup of coffee.

"How was that?" Bob asked.

"Why, every time he jumped up two feet he fell back three."

"Well, we're more'n holding our own and that's better than he did."

Four more days passed and Saturday night came.  In spite of the deep
snow they had on the whole made fairly good time as their muscles
were hardening and they were able to maintain a faster pace.  There
had been no more snow and that which had fallen had drifted so hard
that in most places it held the sled and dogs though, of course,
Lucky and the boys were obliged to wear snow-shoes.  In view of the
fact that they were on a trip where time might mean a man's life they
had decided that they were justified in traveling on Sunday although
under other circumstances they would not have considered it.  The
weather had been cold, the thermometer rarely getting above ten below
zero and one morning it had sunk to thirty below.

Each night they had heard the howls of timber wolves and a number of
times they had caught sight of a slim gray form in the distance.  The
knowledge that the pack was still following them was far from
comforting but, being well armed with both rifles and revolvers, they
had no real fear.

Thursday morning Jack had shot a small buck deer and the meat was a
very welcome addition to their larder as they had brought with them
only enough fresh meat for a couple of days.  Their respect and
liking for the Indian increased every day for they found him not only
abounding in resourcefulness, but he had proved, as Jack put it, a
mighty likeable fellow.

"I always thought Indians were solemn and never laughed or anything
of that sort," he said to Bob one day as they were some distance
behind the sled, Lucky leading the way.

"They usually are more or less that way, but Lucky can laugh as well
as the next fellow."

"You bet he can.  Probably it's the way he's been brought up," Jack
suggested.

"We heet river one more day," Lucky told them that night as they were
washing up after supper.

"You mean we'll be there tomorrow night?" Bob asked.

"Heem 'bout forty mile," Lucky said.

"Then we'll make it sure," Jack declared.

Besides the Canuck they had encountered their first day out they had
seen but two men and these they had met the day after the storm.
They had seemed well disposed Canucks and, learning that they had
come from up the river, they had inquired if they had seen anything
of their uncle.  But neither of them had.

It was just as dusk was beginning to settle the next day that they
came in sight of the river.  For a couple of miles they had been
climbing a gentle slope, and, as they reached the top, they could see
two rivers about a mile away.

"Big one heem Yukon an' leetle one Kayakuk," Lucky told them pointing
with his hand.

"But how do we get down to it?" Bob asked.  "It looks as though it
went off almost perpendicularly here and it must be a drop of nearly
a hundred feet."

"Path down off jest leetle way.  Injun show you."

Bob was about to turn back when a startled cry from Jack, who had
been standing a few feet nearer the edge of the hill, made him look
around just in time to see his brother disappear over the edge
together with a vast smother of snow.  For an instant he was
petrified with fear.

"He--he's gone," he gasped.  Then, as reason returned, he shouted:

"Jack!  Jack!"

But there was no answer.  The Indian had said nothing, but Bob could
see that he was shaking as with the palsy.

"Where's that pass down?" he shouted.  "Maybe he's not dead."

The question seemed to galvanize the Indian to action and, leaving
the dogs, he led the way a little to the right where a more gentle
descent offered.

"White boy be careful," the Indian cautioned as Bob started down, but
he had no thought but to get to the bottom as quickly as possible.

It was very steep even here and several times he lost his footing and
fell, once turning over three or four times before recovering
himself.  Only one thought was in his mind--Jack was in danger,
perhaps dead.  It seemed to the frantic boy that ages passed before
he reached the bottom, but in reality it was only a few seconds.  The
last twenty feet or so was the steepest and, in his rush, he tripped
and rolled to the bottom.  But he was not hurt and, quickly picking
himself up, he started as fast as he could go for the place where
Jack had gone over.  A projection cut off his view until he was
within a few feet of the spot.

"O, God, don't let him be dead," he prayed as he hurried along.

With his heart in his mouth he rounded the turn and the next instant
a low cry of joy burst from his lips.  There, not twenty feet away
sat Jack rubbing his eyes as though he had just woke up.  At Bob's
cry he turned.

"Why didn't you come down by the short route?" he grinned.

"Thank God," Bob breathed as he hastened to Jack's side.  "Jack, boy,
I--I thought you were killed," he sobbed.

"Well, not so you'd notice it," Jack assured him.

"White boy sure no hurt?  Heap bad fall."

Lucky was standing just behind Bob a look of intense relief on his
face.

"Well, I haven't had time yet to take account of stock, but so far's
I know I'm all here."

"It's a miracle you weren't killed."

"Oh, I don't know.  You see, so much snow came down with me that I
lit as light as a feather." Jack grinned.

"Didn't you hear me yelling?" Bob asked.

"No.  You see I was about six feet more or less underneath when I
landed and about the time you were yelling I reckon I was pawing my
way surfaceward."

"Where are your snow-shoes?" Bob asked.

"Down below.  I'm afraid they didn't come through as well as I did."

"White boys stay here Injun git team, git shovel."  Lucky turned and
was gone before they had time to say anything.

"Believe me, he was one scared Indian when he saw you go over that
cliff.  Don't ever tell me that Indians have no feelings or that they
never show them.  If ever I saw fear and sorrow on a human face if
was then."

"I'd like to have seen him," Jack said as he got to his feet.

"Well, I never want to see it again," Bob assured him.

"And, of course I wouldn't want anything to happen to bring it there.
I didn't mean that.  Only I've always thought that Indians never did
show their feelings, you know."

It was nearly half an hour before Lucky came around the bend with the
team as he had to go some little distance before finding a place
where he could get the sled down safely.  Stopping the team he
quickly got a shovel from the stores and in a few minutes had
recovered the shoes.  As Jack had thought they had not come off as
well as he.  One of the frames was broken and several of the strips
of rawhide had snapped in the other.

"Not much bust," the Indian told them as he held them up.  "Injun got
one more pair an' heem feex dees in queek time tonight."

If was almost dark by the time the Indian had found the extra pair of
snow-shoes and they were ready to start once more.  About a mile up
the smaller river from where it emptied into the Yukon they had seen
a small piece of woods and the Indian told them that they would make
camp there for the night.

"Leetle town 'bout twenty mile up river," Lucky told them after they
had eaten supper and were sitting around the fire.

"What's its name?" Bob asked.

"Heem name Red Shirt."

"Red what?" Jack demanded.

"Heem Red Shirt."

"Some name."

"How big a town is it?" Bob asked.

"Not beeg.  You mean how leetle heem be, eh?"

"All right, how little is it?" Bob laughed.

"Heem seex mebby seven cabin.  Mebby twenty Injuns an' Canucks."

"Wonder if they have movies there?" Jack smiled.

"What heem?"

"Didn't you ever see moving pictures?"

"What heem?" the Indian asked again.

Jack described the moving picture as well as he was able, but it was
evident that the Indian did not get a very good idea of what he was
talking about.



A NEW KIND OF BED-ROOM.

It was shortly after noon the following day when they reached the
town of Red Shirt.  The half dozen or so log cabins were huddled
closely together at the foot of a fairly high mountain and the first
person they saw, a huge bulk of a man with a thick shaggy red beard,
wore a shirt of the brightest red.

"That must be the shirt," Jack whispered to Bob.

"It's red enough anyway," Bob whispered back.

The man was standing on the porch of the largest of the cabins which,
somewhat to the boy's surprise, proved to be a store well stocked
with goods.

"Howdy," he greeted them as they came to a stop an front of the store.

"How do you do," both boys answered his salutation while Lucky
grunted "how."

"Why, eets Lucky Hogan," the man said as he recognized the Indian
who's back had been turned until he spoke.

"Oui, it's me," he said holding out his hand which the other grasped.
"An' them boys dey Bob an' Jack Lakewood.  Heap fine boys."

"Ver' glad know yer," the big man smiled shaking hands with them in
turn.  "Come in where eet be warm."

A huge stove, its sides red hot, in the center of the room made the
heat seem almost stifling to the boys after the long continued cold
outside.

"Whar yer go, eh?"

They were hardly inside before the man asked the question.

"We hardly know," Bob told him.  "You see, we are looking for my
uncle who came up here ten or twelve weeks ago and has not been heard
from since.  We thought you might have seen him."

"Heem name Lakewood?"

"Yes, Silas Lakewood and he was with a man by the name of Long."

"Jeem Long?"

"I do not know his first name."

"That heem, Jeem," Lucky broke in.  "You know Jeem," he added turning
to the big man.

"Oui, I know heem," he replied in a tone which expressed dislike if
not hatred.

"Did you see them?" Bob asked a bit impatiently.

"Oui, I see 'em both."

"Do you remember how long ago it was?"

"Eet quite some long time, mebby tree month, mebby only two, I dunno."

"They stopped here?"

"Oui, two mebby tree day."

"And did they say where they were going?"

"Non.  They seem have beeg secret.  No tell whar dey go."

"But they went up river?"

"Oui."

"And you haven't seen or heard from them since?"

"Non.  No see, no hear."

"What do you know about this man, Long?" Bob asked after a moment's
silence.

"Heem no bon.  Heem one bad man."

"You mean he's a thief?"

"Mebby.  Heem bad man.  No bon."

Just then the door opened and a man entered.

"Thees Jere Laduc," the storekeeper introduced him.  "Heem jest come
from up river.  Mebby heem seen 'em."  Then turning to the new-comer
he asked: "Yer see Jeem Long up river, Jere?"

The Canuck, a small wiry looking man, with a smooth face, took off
his cap and scratched his head thoughtfully before answering.

"Oui," he said finally.  "I see Jeem Long."

"Was there another man with him?" Bob asked.

"Oui, beeg man."

"Do you know his name?"

Jere scratched his head again.

"I forget.  I hear heem, oui, but no remember."

"Was it Lakewood?"

"Dat eet, Lakewood."

"Where did you see them?"

"Eet was 'bout ten mile above Batzahakat."

"Is that a town?"

"Oui."

"How far from here?"

"Hunered mile."

"And how long ago was it that you saw them?"

The breed scratched his head a long time before answering.

"Eet must be two month," he finally concluded.

"You know him, this man, Long?"

"Oui, heem no bon."

There was no hesitation this time.

"Testimony seems to be unanimous on that point at any rate," Jack
whispered.

"Did he tell you where he was going?" was Bob's next question.

"Non, heem no say."

"Do you know if they went north?"

"Dunno.  Dey leave early in mornin'.  Me no see 'em go."

"I guess that's about all the information we'll get here," Bob
whispered to Jack.

"Looks that way," Jack agreed.

The storekeeper invited them to stay over a night in the settlement
but, after a brief conference, they decided that time was too
precious and that they would push on.  So, after thanking him and
purchasing a few things they needed, they said good bye and started
off up the river.  Altogether they had stopped an hour and, although
they had learned nothing which was very definite except that their
uncle had really been there, somehow the boys felt slightly
encouraged.

"Evidently that man Long's a bad egg," Jack said as they trudged out
of the village.

"Everyone seems to think so," Bob agreed.

"The inhabitants of this burg seem to keep pretty close indoors,"
Jack remarked just as they struck the river.

"Them eat dinner now," Lucky told him.

On the river the traveling was good and they made twenty-five miles
before camping for the night.

"River tak' heap beeg bend leetle way above here an', in the mornin'
we go east, cut off mebby twenty mile," the Indian told them.

For the past three days they had heard nothing from the wolves and
both boys hoped that they had given up following them.  Lucky
shrugged his shoulders when Bob mentioned it as if to say that it did
not matter to him one way or the other.

"Any fish in this river, Lucky," Jack asked as soon as they had cut
the wood for the night.

"Oui, heap beeg salmon.  Some trout."

"Suppose I could catch one through the ice?"

"Dunno, mebby."

"Well, I've got a hook and line and I'm going to make a stab at it.
Fresh fish won't go bad."

They were camping in a clump of woods just a few yards from the river
and, taking one of the axes, Jack was soon cutting a hole in the ice.
This took longer than he had thought for the ice was nearly eighteen
inches thick and it was pretty dark by the time he was ready to drop
in his hook which he had baited with a piece of pork.

"Hope they like pork," he said to himself as he dropped in the hook.

His hope was quickly realized for before the bait had sunk more than
five or six feet he felt a strong yank and pulled in a trout nearly
fifteen inches long.  Quickly he rebaited the hook and dropped it
back through the hole.  This time he had to wait a little longer, but
inside of twenty minutes he had landed three more trout and two
salmon of about five pounds weight each.

"Not bad for the first time," he chuckled as he strung them together
on a bit of line which he found in his pocket.

"Yer catch um feesh?" Lucky asked as he came whistling up in the
gathering darkness.

"What did I go after?" he asked.

"Feesh."

"Well, when I go after fish, fish is what I bring back.  Ask Bob if
you don't believe it."  And he held up the string in the light of the
fire.

"Yer catch um," Lucky declared.

"He always does," Bob assured him.  "That boy could catch fish in a
water bucket."

Soon the two salmon were sizzling in the frying pan and they proved a
very welcome addition to their fare.

The next morning they were up early and just as day was breaking,
they left the river and struck off due east.  The sun came up thickly
overcast and Lucky gave it as his opinion that it would snow before
noon.

"You're a good weather prophet, Lucky," Jack said when, a little
after ten o'clock, the first flakes began to fall.

There was no wind and the snowflakes at first drifted lazily to the
earth as if in no hurry to get there.  Soon they were coming in
greater abundance and, although there was still no wind, the boys
noticed that the Indian was casting an anxious eye toward the sky.

"You think it's going to be a bad storm?" Jack asked him.

"No wind all right.  Wind heem begin blow be heap bad.  No woods for
many mile."

"Well, the snow has held off for a good while for this time of year
so I suppose we ought not to kick if we do get it now," Bob said
philosophically.

"I reckon it's going to blow some at least," Jack said an hour later
as he felt a slight breeze fan his face.  "Those flakes aren't coming
down straight any more."

It was snowing hard and there was a fairly strong breeze when they
stopped for dinner at twelve o'clock although it was not yet strong
enough to cause the snow to sting.

"About how far from here is there a piece of timber," Bob asked as
they were getting ready to start off again.

"Mebby twenty mile, mebby leetle more."

Enough snow had already fallen to make it hard going and within an
hour they were taking turns breaking trail for the dogs.  The wind
was steadily increasing in force and the snow showed no sign of
abatement.

"We'll never make that woods tonight at the rate we're going," Jack
declared.

"Non, we no mak' heem.  We look for bon place mak' camp.  Heem goin'
blow heap hard soon."

Lucky was right again for they had not been traveling an hour before
the wind had risen to the force of a gale and was driving the sharp
particles of snow against their faces with stinging violence.

"Whew, but this is work," Jack panted as he came back from breaking
trail to allow Lucky to take his turn.

"I'll say you're right," Bob agreed.

It was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead and it was a
mystery to the boys how the Indian could keep a straight course
especially as the wind seemed to change its direction frequently.
But he seemed sure of his way and the boys had no reason to doubt his
judgment.

By half past two the dogs began to show signs of distress and the
Indian gave it as his opinion that they had better stop.

"No must keel um dog," he declared.

"I'll say we mustn't, but how are we going to camp here in the open?"
Bob asked.

"Injun show white boys."

All day they had been traveling over a flat country and there was not
even a hill to give them the slightest protection.  Still they felt
sure that Lucky knew best and if he said camp why, camp it was.

"We mak' um house," he said as he pulled the shovels from the sled.
"We sleep all right, but have eat cold supper, no got wood."

The prospect was anything but pleasant, but the boys were not unused
to hardships and there was no grumbling as they set to work digging a
hole in the snow under directions from the Indian.

"Mak' heem 'bout eight feet long an' seex wide," he told them, as he
turned to care for the dogs.

There was now about four feet of snow on the level, and, as the old
snow was packed down very hard, it took them some little time to
complete the task.

"Reckon it'll drift in about as fast as we can shovel it out," Jack
grumbled as he threw out the last few; shovelfuls of snow.

"Then we can have the pleasure of shoveling it out again," Bob
laughed.

"I believe you'd laugh if you were going to be hanged."

"Not quite that bad, but might as well laugh as cry, you know."

Thanks to Lucky's thoughtfulness in bringing along a small alcohol
stove they were able to make coffee which made the supper seem a
little more cheerful.

"What about the dogs?" Bob asked.

"Dog all right.  No mind snow if not too tired," the Indian assured
them.

It was only a little after four o'clock when they finished supper,
but it was already dark.  Not that it made so much difference, as
Jack declared, seeing that the snow was coming down so fast that they
could only see a short distance anyhow.

"You shovel um out again and we feex roof," Lucky said as soon as the
meal was finished.

"What you going to make a roof out of?" Jack asked.

"I show white boy.  You geet snow out."

The snow was already several inches deep in the dugout, as Jack
called it, but they made short work of it and finished just as the
Indian dragged up a piece of canvas about twelve feet long and eight
wide.

"I see what our roof's to be now," Jack laughed.

When spread over the dugout the canvas overlapped about three feet on
each side and on it they shoveled snow, stamping it down good and
hard with their feet.

"Now heem hold some snow," the Indian declared when they had two feet
or more of hard packed snow on either end.

"But it won't hold up all night if it keeps up like this," Bob said
doubtfully.

"We clean heem off one two time, mebby."

"Mebby is right," Bob laughed.

It was very cold, but after they had crawled info the dugout and into
their sleeping bags they were plenty warm.

"If we only could have gotten some boughs," Jack complained.  "This
ground was laid hard side up."

"You ought to be thankful that you've got any ground to lie on," Bob
told him.

"Is that intended for a joke?"

"No.  Why?"

"I thought there was no ground for it."

"Smarty."

"Well, don't blame me.  I was born that way, you know."

"Just hear that wind," Bob said a few minutes later.  "I can't help
feeling sorry for the poor dogs outside."

"Them dog all huddle up together.  Keep um all warm," Lucky assured
them.

"But they'll be buried before morning," Jack objected.

"Sure, snow heap warm.  No mind that."

"Well, I'm glad to know that they won't suffer.  It's snug as a bug
in a rug in here," Jack declared.

"How about a story, Lucky?" Bob asked.

For more than two hours, while the storm howled and blew outside, the
Indian entertained them with wonderful stories of the North Land.  He
was a splendid story teller in spite of his broken English and they
could hardly believe it when he announced that it was nearly eight
o'clock and time they were asleep.

"Injun shovel off snow an' den we go sleep," he said as he wiggled
out of his bag.

"Is it snowing as hard as ever?" Bob asked when he slid back into the
dugout.

"Heem come down heap hard."

"Guess we'll have to hole up here for the rest of the winter," Jack
said.

"Not so bad if we could sleep all the time," Bob laughed.

In spite of the hard ground they were soon fast asleep.  Bob awoke
some hours later and felt the Indian moving at his side.

"Anything wrong?" he whispered

"Injun shovel off snow one time more.  Roof heem sag some," Lucky
whispered back.

Reaching up with his hand Bob could tell that the roof was indeed
sagging.

"Let me go this time," he said.

"Non, Injun no mind eet."

Bob was asleep when the Indian returned and did not hear him.  Some
time later he dreamed that he was lying at the foot of a high
precipice.  Overhead, jutting out from the top of the cliff, hung a
volume of snow which he knew was about to fall on him.  And yet he
was unable to move try as he might.  He could see the immense mass,
slowly slipping at first, and then gathering speed as it approached.
He wondered why it did not fall more rapidly.  It seemed to take a
fearful long time getting down, but, finally it was just above his
head and he closed his eyes as he realized that he would be buried in
another instant.  Then it struck.

"What the Sam Hill!" he heard some one say in tones which sounded far
off.

"Roof heem fall in," another voice answered.

Realizing at last that he was awake and that his dream had, in a
measure, come true almost before it was over, he began to paw his way
out.  But the others were also pawing and soon they were all tangled
up in a mass of canvas and snow.

"Wait till I get my bearings, you fellows," he shouted.

"Get 'em quick then or I'll suffocate," Jack gasped.

After what seemed an interminable time, and during which Jack urged
him to hurry, he succeeded in getting hold of an edge of the canvas
and crawling out from beneath it Then he quickly pulled it from off
the others and soon they were all standing up.  It was still snowing
hard and the wind seemed to be blowing hard as ever.

"Some spill, that," Jack declared.

"Spill is right," Bob agreed.

"Heap lot snow," Lucky added.

"Well, what'll we do?" Jack asked after a moment's pause.

"What time is it?" Bob asked.

"Half past five."

"Better dig out and fix the roof again, hadn't we?" Bob proposed.

"What do you say, Lucky?"

"Oui, better do."

It was very dark, but they had flashlights with them and by their aid
they quickly located the shovels in one corner of the dugout and the
two boys fell to work while the Indian busied himself getting the
strip of canvas straightened out.

It took the better part of an hour to get their home cleaned out and
the roof on again, but it was finally accomplished and they were once
more, as Jack put it, stowed away again.  None of them were inclined
to sleep so they fell to discussing the situation.

"Will it pay to start out while it's storming?" Bob asked.

"Non.  Eet too hard on dog," the Indian told them.

"To say nothing of the effect on us," Jack chuckled.

"But we can't stay here forever," Bob objected.

"Wind, heem changing.  Snow stop leetle while."

"Hope you're right," Jack said.

"Which he usually is," Bob put in.

And this time was no exception to the rule for, shortly before seven
o'clock, the Indian, after sticking his head out, declared that it
was only snowing a "leetle" and that the wind was dying down.

"We geet hot coffee an' a bite an' den we start, eh?"

"So say we all of us," Jack sang.

Their progress that day was distressingly slow to the boys who were
ever fearful that, if they found their uncle at all, it would be too
late.  But they were obliged to consider the dogs.  They were willing
to do all that could be asked of them, but there was a limit to their
endurance and dragging the heavily loaded sled through the deep snow
was no easy task.  Still, as Jack put it, they were more than holding
their own and, about four o'clock they came to woods and here they
decided to make camp, cheered by Lucky's assurance that they would
reach the town the next day.

They had brought the rest of the fish Jack had caught, with them and
how good a hot meal did taste.

"I tell you, you never appreciate a thing till you have to do without
it," Bob declared as he readied for his third helping.



TIMBER WOLVES.

The town of Batzahakat is very much like Red Shirt.  A few log
cabins, one of which serves as a store, huddled together on the bank
of the river.  It was growing dark when two very tired boys and six
nearly played out dogs and an Indian, who acknowledged that he had
been more rested, dragged themselves up the bank and made their way
along the single short street to the store.

"Do you know the man who keeps the store?" Bob had asked the Indian
earlier in the day.

"Oui, Injun know heem.  Heem name Jules Lamont.  Heem Frenchman, no
breed," Lucky told them.

"Is he all right?" Bob had asked.

"Oui, heem bon man," Lucky had assured them.

And now they soon found that he was again right for, as soon as they
had entered the store, Jules Lamont gave them a hearty welcome and
assured them that he had plenty of room for them in his cabin just
out behind.

Jules Lamont had a wife who was fully as kind in her welcome as was
he and she was a splendid cook as they soon learned.

"Gee, but it seems kind of good to get into a bed once more," Jack
said when, soon after supper, their host had shown them to a well
furnished room above the living room.  There were two beds in the
room and Lucky occupied the other.

Yes, he remembered Silas Lakewood very well and the man Long as well,
he told them the next morning when, while eating breakfast, they told
him of their errand.

"They stay here three four days," he told them in almost perfect
English.

"Did they say where they were going?" Bob asked.

"They say they go up river, but not how far."

"And you haven't seen them since?"

"Not since."

"Do you remember just how long ago it was they were here?" was Bob's
next question.

"Pretty hard say.  Time goes ver' slow up here an' I forget.  Mebby
seven weeks, mebby eight or nine, but no more than nine sure."

"Do you know Long?" Jack asked.

"Oui, I know him long time."

"What kind of a man is he?"

"Not good.  I not trust him."

"He's sure got a bad reputation," Jack said.  "We haven't heard a
single good word about him yet."

"After breakfast over we go see some other men an' ask them what they
know," Jules told them.

He had urged them the night before to stay over a day and they had
agreed after Lucky had assured them that a day's rest would be of
great benefit to the dogs and that they would more than make up for
the lost time.

"One day geeve snow time to settle an' mak' more bon goin'," he
assured them.

By noon they had interviewed probably nearly everyone in the village,
Jules going with them and introducing them.  They found the people
universally courteous and eager to be of service, but they learned no
more than they already knew.  It was evident that neither their uncle
or Long had confided in anyone, keeping their destination a secret.

The next morning they got an early start.  Although it would be
several hours before the sun would make its appearance, it was not
dark as the moon was full.  The dogs had indeed profited by their
day's rest and had fully recovered their eagerness or pep as Jack put
it.  It was twenty-five degrees below zero when they drove off after
thanking their host and hostess for their kindness.

"We ver' glad to have you an' hope you find your uncle all right an'
hope you stop longer time on way back," Jules Lamont told them as he
shook hands.

"We'd sure like to and will if we can," they assured him.

"He's a mighty fine man," Bob said as soon as they were out of the
village.

"And his wife's a queen if there ever was one," Jack added.

"If you've got any more friends like them up this way just lead us to
them," Bob told Lucky.

"Jules, heem best, but they some others," Lucky said.

Their way now lay straight up the river and, as the snow had settled,
they were able to make better time especially as they found that two
or more teams had been ahead of them and broken a fairly good trail.

They had been traveling for about three hours and the sun was just
beginning to show itself when Jack, who was walking slightly ahead of
the Indian, turned to ask him a question.  Instead of answering him,
to his surprise Lucky grabbed up a handful of snow and the next
instant he was vigorously rubbing Jack's nose with it.

"Hey, there, what's the b-b-big idea?" he sputtered.

"White boy hold still."

"Like f-f-fun I w-w-will.  I-I-I want t-to know--"

"Don't get excited, Jack," Bob laughed.

"But--"

"Your nose was freezing."

"Freezing nothing.  I didn't feel a thing," Jack retorted.

"And that's just what the trouble was.  But I reckon you can feel it
now."

"I'll say I can.  It hurts."

"That's the frost coming out of it.  It'll be all right after a bit,"
Bob assured him.

"Jack have heap bad nose, Injun no rub heem," Lucky explained.

"And I'm much obliged," Jack grinned realizing now that the Indian
had indeed done him a good turn.

They were two days making the next town about eighty miles farther
north.  This was Arctic City, so called because of being situated
exactly on the Arctic Circle.  The weather had held clear and cold
and they had made good time and were in good spirits as they entered
the town about three o'clock.  Although only the middle of the
afternoon it was dark enough for lights in the cabins.  Indeed there
was only about five hours a day during which the sun was above the
horizon.

Arctic City much resembled the other towns through which they had
passed and they found the people much the same type.  They were
kindly received and secured a comfortable room for the night.  During
the evening they interviewed several of the men of the place most of
whom were known to the Indian.  But it was just as they were about to
start off the next morning that they received their first real clue.

The dogs were harnessed and Lucky had already given the order to
"Mush" when a very small man dressed in a heavy bearskin coat shouted
to them to wait a minute.

"Wonder what he wants," Bob said as Lucky ordered the dogs to stop.

"Reckon we'll know in a minute," Jack told him.

"Yer lookin' fer two mans, eh?" the little man asked as he came
puffing up.

"Yes," Bob told him.  "Can you give us any information regarding
them?"

"Mebby.  What der name?"

"Silas Lakewood is one and the other is a man named Long."

"Oui, I see 'em."

"When?" Bob asked the question with much eagerness in his voice.

"'Bout seex week ago."

"And where did you see them?"

"Een Mountain nor' of Beaver."

"Where is Beaver?" Jack broke in.

"'Bout feefty mile nor' here."

"And how far from Beaver are the mountains?"

"'Bout same."

"Please tell us what you knew."

"Oui.  'Bout seex week ago me go up dar hunt bear.  No find heem an'
stay long time, ten day, mebby two week.  Go round ver' mooch.  One
day I see leetle cabin an' smoke come out heem.  I been dar before
an' never see cabin so I know heem new.  I go up an' go to knock on
door when I hear mad man talk.  I leesten an' hear heem say 'you sign
dat paper or you no go away from here.  I leesten an' hear nodder man
say, 'I no sign heem'.  Den odder man heem sware ver' mooch an' I
come away.  I think eet not my beeseness an' I stay mebby I geet
hurt."

"But what makes you think they were the men we are after?" Bob asked
when he had finished.

"I hear one man call odder dat name, Lakewood," the man told them.

"Then I reckon they were the men all right," Bob said turning to Jack
and Lucky.

"No doubt about it," Jack agreed while the Indian nodded his head.

"And do you think they are still there?" Bob asked.

"I dunno 'bout that.  I come away: no see 'em any more."

"Do you know where that place is?" Bob asked turning to Lucky.

"Oui, I been there."

"And you think you can find that cabin?"

Instead of replying the Indian turned to the small man and asked:
"You tell me where heem be, eh?"

"Dar two beeg mountain up dar.  You know heem?"

"Oui."

"Cabin right 'tween 'em 'bout half way een."

"Bon.  I find heem."

Bob pulled a five dollar bill from his pocket and offered it to the
man, but he shook his head.

"Please take it," Bob urged.  "Your information is worth a lot to us
and I want to make you a little present.  Just take it and buy
yourself something."

After a little hesitation the man accepted the bill thanking Bob with
a great display of feeling.

"Well, it looks as though we had something definite to go on now,"
Jack declared as soon as they were once more on the river.

"Do you know that man?" Bob asked the Indian.

"Non."

"You never saw him before?"

"Non."

"Then we don't know whether he was telling the truth or not."

"But why would he lie to us?" Jack asked.

"I don't know unless it was to get some money."

"But he didn't want to take it."

"He didn't seem to you mean."

"Well, maybe, but he looked honest to me."

"And he did to me too.  What do you think, Lucky?"

"I think heem straight."

"Then I reckon it's all right.  We'll take it for granted anyhow
until we find out to the contrary."

Greatly to their disappointment they got no more information in the
little village of Beaver which they reached late that night.  No one
seemed to have seen the men although they found several who said that
they knew Long, but none of them had seen him for more than a year.

"Looks as though they had given this burg the go-by," Jack said when
they were in the little room which they had secured for the night.

"It does look that way," Bob agreed.  "I wonder why?"

"Probably too near the scene of their operations."

"Maybe."

"But the farther north we go the worse that man Long's reputation
seems to get."

"He must be a bad egg for a fact.  He's certainly not popular."

They camped the next night at the beginning of the pass which led
between the two mountains which reared their snowy summits far up
toward the sky.

"Cabin not more'n 'bout two mebby three mile from here," Lucky told
them as he halted the team.  It was only two o'clock, the place not
being so far from the town as they had thought from what the little
Frenchman had told them.  Lucky had told them when starting out that
morning that he thought the man was mistaken as to the distance but,
as he had not been there for a number of years, he was not sure.

They had found a splendid place for a camp.  Beneath an overhanging
rock, the ground was almost free from snow as a circle of thick
spruce trees in front and about twenty feet away had protected it on
the open side.  Here they made beds of thick spruce boughs and a
roaring fire soon warmed the face of the rock by its reflection so
that it seemed impossible that the temperature outside was nearly
forty below.  Before leaving the river early the preceding day, they
had stopped long enough to cut a hole in the ice and allow Jack to
catch a dozen large trout and five or six salmon, enough, as Bob
said, to last them a couple of weeks.

After supper was over they sat for some time in front of the fire and
discussed plans for the morrow.

"We got be ver' careful," Lucky told them.  "Dat man, Long, heem bad
man an' heem get mad he shoot, oui."

"But we'll be three against one, not counting Uncle Silas," Jack
reminded him.

"But heem got gun an' bullet go ver' fast."

"Lucky's right, Jack," Bob declared.  "We must play it safe.  Of
course there may not be any trouble and everything may be all right
and I sure hope it is but if he's keeping Uncle up here against his
will, the way it looks, he's probably playing for big stakes."

"But why should he want to keep him up here?"

"That's what we've got to find out.  According to what that man said
he was trying to get him to sign some paper.  Now, if that's right,
my guess is that they've found gold and he was trying to get him to
sign away his rights to it.  Of course, that's only a guess."

"Heem ver' bon guess," Lucky added.

"Couldn't make a better myself," Jack assured him.

"Then I'm flattered," Bob smiled.

"Then what do you think we'd better do?" Jack asked, turning to the
Indian.

"I tink you better stay here an' Injun go up see what doin'."

"Don't you think it would be better for me to go?" Bob asked.

"White boy no know way," Lucky objected.

"But I couldn't help finding it if it's between these mountains.  You
see, it's this way.  That man Long knows you and if he should see you
he'd smell a mouse, but he's never seen me."

Although the Indian saw the force of the argument and made many
objections to the plan he finally gave in and it was settled that as
soon as it was light enough to see Bob should start to spy out the
land.

That night, for the first time in several days, they heard wolves,
but they were far off and Lucky did not think that they had scented
them.

"White boy be heap careful," was Lucky's parting word the next
morning, as Bob started off just as it was beginning to get light.
It was nearly ten o'clock and he had waited impatiently several hours
for the time to start.  Besides his automatic he took with him a 38
Remington with which he was an expert shot.  It was his favorite
rifle and he was very choice with it.  More than one buck had fallen
before it in the woods of Maine and once it had brought down a large
moose.  With it he felt safe.

Although he could hardly believe it the thermometer said forty below
when he left the camp, but so clear and dry was the air that it
hardly seemed cold at all.

The passage between the mountains was very narrow, in fact, there was
hardly any level ground between them, one seeming to rise at the foot
of the other, so he had little fear of missing the cabin provided it
was really there.  The dry snow creaked pleasantly beneath his
snow-shoes as he strode along humming a favorite song.  Tall trees
grew so closely together that he was unable to keep to anything like
a straight course, but this gave him no worry.  He had the day before
him and there was no hurry.

He had gone perhaps three quarters of a mile when he was brought up
short by a long drawn out howl, seemingly not very far away.

"That was a timber wolf," he thought as he peered anxiously through
the trees.

The howl was answered almost immediately from the side of the other
mountain and, for a moment, he wondered if he would not be wise to
turn back.

"I don't belive ther's more than two of them," he thought as he
listened.

But even as the thought passed through his mind a third howl broke
the stillness and this one was surely behind him.

"Seem to have me surrounded," he muttered, as he started on again.

Whether there were more than three of the wolves he was unable to
tell, but that they were coming nearer there was no doubt.  Soon,
peering through an opening in the trees, he caught sight of a
skulking gray shape just as it raised its head and sent its mournful
howl through the forest.  But that howl was its last for, before it
was finished, he had raised his rifle and sent a bullet crashing
through its head.  The wolf dropped in its tracks, gave a convulsive
kick or two and was still.

"One less anyhow," Bob muttered as he ran forward to where the wolf
was stretched.

About ten yards from where he was standing was a large tree with low
branches and, as another howl rang out not hundred yards away, he ran
toward it resolved to make a stand there knowing that wolves could
not climb a tree and that, if worst came to worst, he could find
temporary safety at least in its branches.

By this time he knew that there were more than three of the beasts
and, by the sounds he judged that there must be nearly a dozen.  Soon
he caught sight of another gray form and, quickly raising his rifle,
fired his second shot.  The wolf fell but, almost before he was
stretched on the snow, from all sides, gray shapes sprang upon him
and in an incredibly short time the dead wolf was torn in pieces and
devoured.  A moment later and the first one killed was discovered and
had shared a like fate.  And still the ravenous beasts were not
satisfied and in less than ten minutes from the time he had fired the
second shot the pack was gathered in a semi-circle about twenty-five
feet away, snapping and snarling and gradually closing in.  He had
not fired again hoping that they would be satisfied with the feast
already provided and go away.  But their appetite seemed only to be
whetted and he fired again.

"Here's where little Bobby seeks safer quarters while they're busy,"
he muttered as he swung himself up onto the lowest branch of the
tree.  "I imagine Jack and Lucky'll hear the rumpus and come to my
rescue," he thought.  "Anyhow I'm safe enough and can pick them off
at my leisure, if they choose to stay around."

The third wolf was quickly dispatched and the pack, about fifteen in
number were soon gathered beneath the tree voicing their
disappointment in mournful howls.  Taking careful aim at the largest
beast he pulled the trigger but, to his surprise, only a slight click
resulted.  Thinking there might be a defective cartridge in the rifle
he pulled back the ejector.  But to his dismay it stuck when half way
back.

"Now I am in a fix," he said half aloud.  "Mighty funny the thing had
to stick at just this time especially when it's never done it before."

All this time he had been working feverishly in an effort to remove
the cartridge, but he soon found that, without the aid of a
screwdriver, it could not be done.

Then the thought that he had his automatic came to him and he took
new heart.  But his joy was short lived for the revolver was gone.
He couldn't understand it, he told himself over and over again.  He
distinctly remembered shoving it into place in his belt just before
starting.  Then he remembered that, a short time before he heard the
first wolf, he had tripped and fallen headlong.

"It must have dropped out when I fell," he told himself.  "Wouldn't I
have been in a nice fix if there had been no trees anywhere around?"
And he shuddered as he looked down at the hungry beasts only a few
feet beneath him.

He knew that he was safe so far as the wolves were concerned, but the
intense cold was beginning to work through his clothing.  Hustling
along on snow-shoes at forty below zero was one thing, but roosting
up in the branches of a tree at the same temperature was quite
another, he told himself.  He wondered why Jack and Lucky had not put
in an appearance and then, for the first time he noticed that a
strong wind was blowing and that it was coming from the direction of
the camp.

"Perhaps that wind's so strong that they haven't heard the wolves or
the shots," he thought.

It seemed that his last thought must be correct for a full hour
passed and there was no sign of his friends.  He knew it would be of
no use to shout for if they had not heard the wolves and his shots it
was dead certain that they would not hear him.  If they had heard
anything to give them the idea that he might be in trouble they would
have had no trouble in following his tracks as they were the only
ones visible.  Hence, he reasoned, they had heard nothing.  He did
not know whether it was growing colder or not, but he was quite sure
that he was, and, having a firm seat in a crotch, he spent much of
the time beating his body with his arms in an effort to keep out as
much of the cold as possible.

The wolves showed no signs of giving up.  To be sure they were no
longer leaping and howling, but had assumed an attitude of what he
called watchful waiting.  It was, he knew, only a question of being
able to stand the cold long enough.  Jack and Lucky would be after
him when he did not return soon after they would expect him.

Another hour passed and he began, for the first time, to be really
frightened.  For a long time he had been shaking with the cold, but
now he did not feel nearly so cold and a peculiar drowsiness was
stealing over him, an almost overwhelming desire to sleep.  He knew
what that meant and, with all the force of his will, he fought
against it.  For awhile he kept changing his position, but now he
feared to move for fear he would fall.  So he wedged himself in a
crotch between the trunk and a large limb in such a way that in case
he lost consciousness his body would be held.

"God grant that they may come in time," was his last conscious
thought and then he drifted off into nothingness.



THE RESCUE.

"Isn't it about time Bob was getting back?"

Jack looked at his watch as he asked the question.

"What time heem be?" Lucky asked

"Quarter past one."

"Oui, heem ought be here ver' soon."

"You don't suppose anything has happened to him?" Jack asked
anxiously.

"Non, but wind heem change.  We goin' have snow."

"Well I wish he'd come.  Somehow I feel uneasy."

"Heem come soon."

For another half hour they waited, Jack getting more and more uneasy.

"Hark!"

"That wolf."

"And it came from up that way."  Jack indicated the direction which
Bob had taken.

"Geet gun, we go queek."

Throwing some wood on the fire so that it would last until they
should return they quickly tied on their snow-shoes and, taking their
rifles, were off at the fastest pace they could muster.

"You think the wolves are after him?" Jack asked as they hurried
along.

"Mebby.  But heem climb tree."

"But he'd have shot and we didn't hear any shots."

"Wind, heem wrong."

They had gone but a short distance when Jack's quick eye caught sight
of something lying nearly concealed in the snow.  Stooping he picked
up Bob's automatic.

"It's Bob's," he gasped holding it out so that the Indian could see
it.

"Oui, heem Bob's."

"But how did it come here?"

"See, heem fall here.  Mebby gun heem fall out."

"But I don't see how it could have," Jack objected.

"Heem fall here," Lucky insisted.

"Sure he did, but I don't see how he could have lost this gun.  But
it won't do any good to stand here talking about it."

They had heard the mournful howl of the wolves several times since
they started, and Jack grew more and more alarmed as they advanced
and he could see that the Indian was not entirely easy in his mind
although he was doing his best to conceal it.

"We ver' near where wolf be," Lucky declared as a long drawn out howl
came from only a short distance ahead.

"Sounds that way," Jack agreed.

"Have gun ready."

"You bet."

They hurried along for a few minutes and then Lucky, who was a few
feet ahead of Jack, suddenly stopped and raised his rifle.  Instantly
a shot rang through the woods followed by a loud yelp of pain.  Jack
hurried to his side and from there could see the pack as they
gathered about the foot of the tree.  But at that moment they were
engaged in a mad fight to see which should get the choicer portions
of their fallen comrade.

"Let heem have eet," Lucky shouted, and Jack began pumping lead into
the pack as rapidly as he could work the ejector.

Wild yelps of pain mingled with the fierce growls of combat filled
the air.  Then, just as Jack had emptied the magazine of his rifle,
one of the wolves saw them and with a sharp bark of anger left the
pack and sprang toward them.  Jack saw that the wolf would be upon
them before he could get his rifle loaded and cast a quick glance at
the Indian.  But he too had exhausted his magazine and was hurriedly
loading.  The wolf was now only a few feet away and behind him were
several others and he knew there was not an instant to lose.
Dropping his gun he snatched his automatic from his belt and, just as
the leading animal was about to take the final spring, he fired.  The
huge wolf fell dead at his feet a bullet in his brain, but another
was upon them almost instantly.  Jack fired again, but this time he
must have missed for the wolf did not stop and before he could fire
again he was upon him.  As they came to the ground Jack succeeded in
getting a firm hold on the long hair at the beast's neck and, pushing
with all his strength, he was able to keep the huge jaws away from
his throat.  Over and over they rolled in the snow, but almost at
once the boy heard the crack of Lucky's rifle and knew that the
Indian had loaded and was firing again.

After what seemed a long time and just when it seemed that he could
not hold those terrible jaws away another instant he heard a muffled
shot close at hand and instantly he felt a convulsive shudder pass
through the wolfs body and the head fell forward in his grasp.
Flinging it from him he sprang to his feet.

"Heem hurt you?"

"Only a few scratches I reckon," Jack panted.  "Where are the rest of
them?"

"Them run, but we kill most all."

Jack quickly glanced toward the tree, but only the still forms lying
on the snow met his gaze.

"Bob must be up that tree," he said as he looked about for his
automatic which had fallen from his hand when the wolf hit him.  He
located it almost at once and, shoving it into his belt, he picked up
his rifle and started for the Indian who was already nearly to the
tree.

"Bob!  Bob!  Oh Bob!" he shouted as he ran.

But there was no answer and his heart almost stopped beating as he
joined Lucky beneath the branches of the tree.

"You--you don't--" he began, but the Indian interrupted.

"Heem must be up thar."

"Take my rifle and I'll have a look," Jack said as he handed over the
gun and swung himself up.

"He's here," he called a minute later.  "But--but I can't seem to
wake him."

The Indian was beside him almost before he had finished speaking.

"Heem no dead," he declared after he had laid his ear over his heart.
"We geet heem down an' back to camp queek."

It was hard work getting the heavy body down out of the tree, but
they did it quickly knowing that a moment more or less might well
mean his life.  The ground seem literally covered with the bodies of
the wolves, but they took no heed of them as they quickly fastened on
their snow-shoes and started back, the Indian carrying Bob over his
shoulder.  Fortunately Jack's shoes had not been damaged in the fight
and he went ahead carrying their rifles.  Not once did the Indian
stop and he refused to allow Jack to carry him or to help, asserting
that they could make better time that way.  Jack was amazed at the
Indian's strength and the speed which he was able to maintain with
such a heavy load.

Arrived back the Indian laid the still form on a blanket over the bed
of boughs and started rubbing his limbs while Jack hurried to get out
their medicine case.  For fully fifteen minutes they worked before
the first sign of returning life rewarded them.  Over and over Jack
moaned that he was dead, but the Indian insisted that it was not so
and they kept on.  Then Jack noticed a slight twitching of one eyelid
and fell to work with renewed hope.

"Heem heart geet stronger," Lucky assured him.

"He's opening his eyes," Jack declared a moment later.

A low moan followed Jack's words and Bob opened his eyes.  A faint
smile played about his mouth, but he was too weak to speak.

"Don't try, old man," Jack cried.

"Tank de Bon Father," Lucky murmured.

They continued to work on him for some time and as the color returned
to his face Jack thanked God over and over again for His great
goodness.

"We see him feet froze," Lucky said after a little.

Quickly they unlaced the moccasins and pulled off the heavy woolen
socks.

"Oui, dem froze," Lucky declared.

"Badly?"

"Non, no bad.  Rub wid snow."

Jack did as ordered and had the great satisfaction of seeing the
color come slowly back.

"Them be heap sore for 'while, but them geet well," Lucky declared
after a few minutes.

By this time Bob was able to whisper a few words, but the Indian
cautioned him to save his strength and soon he fell into a deep sleep.

"More heem sleep now the better," Lucky assured Jack.

"You think he'll be all right?"

"Oui, eef heem no have pneumonia."

"You think there's danger of it?"

"Some, but heem ver' strong an' clean.  Mebby heem no geet eet."

They took turns watching by his side through the long hours of the
night fearful lest the dreaded fever develop.  But Bob slept nearly
all the time, waking only to ask for water.  Once Jack was sure that
he had a temperature and awakened the Indian.  But he thought not and
a little later slight drops of moisture on his forehead proved that
he was right.

Morning came at last and with it the glad news from Lucky that the
danger was passed and that Bob would be all right.

"But eet one ver' close call," he said.

Bob was very weak, too weak in fact to talk much and the Indian
insisted that he keep perfectly quiet.  With the light came the first
flakes of snow presaging the coming of the storm which the Indian had
been expecting.

"Injun mak' hut, you tend heem," he ordered.

He took one of the axes and went off into the woods to return a few
minutes later dragging a number of long poles which he had trimmed
clear of branches.  With these and a lot of spruce boughs he quickly
fashioned a rude, but strong tepee large enough to accommodate the
three of them.

"You think it's going to be a bad storm?" Jack asked after they had
placed Bob inside.

"Mebby.  Most storm some bad up here."

"How long will it be before Bob is able to go on?"

"Two, mebby three day."

"Well, we must wait till he's all right."

"Oui, we wait."

In less than an hour if was evident that they were in for another
blizzard and they spent the greater part of the day getting in a
large supply of firewood.  Fortunately they found a number of dead
trees only a short distance off and by dark Lucky was certain that
they had enough to last for at least three days.  Bob had slept most
of the time and seemed stronger every time he awoke.  About four
o'clock he awoke and wanted to know if it wasn't most time to eat.
He ate all the Indian would let him and then declared that he was
strong enough to tell them of his adventure.

"All right, but you stop queek you geet tired," Lucky cautioned him.

"I know I was going to sleep, simply couldn't help it, and I was
almost equally sure that I wouldn't wake up in this world," he told
them when he had finished.

"We must have gotten there very soon after you went to sleep," Jack
said.

"Oui, ver' queek or heem no wake," Lucky added

"How many wolves did you kill?" Bob asked.

"We didn't stop to count them," Jack laughed.  "But we must have shot
all of a dozen.  What do you think, Lucky?"

"Mebby dozen, mebby more.  Two three got 'way."

"Well, I hope I never see another wolf as long as I live," Bob
declared.

"Same here," Jack added.

"We see heap more," Lucky shook his head.

"I suppose so," Jack agreed.

"Injun do wrong let boy go."

"None of that stuff now," Bob said quickly.  "I'd have been all right
if I hadn't been clumsy enough to lose my gun and that wasn't your
fault."

"But Injun--"

"Forget it," and Lucky never mentioned the subject again.

All that night and all the following day it snowed and blew.  How the
wind did blow outside, but beneath the overhang of the cliff where
they had pitched the tepee it was comparatively still and thanks to
the thick circle of trees, only a small amount of snow found its way
to them.  At one side, but beneath the overhang, Lucky had
constructed a rough shelter for the dogs and they were, as Jack had
said, "well stabled."

Long before both Jack and Bob had made warm friends with the members
of the team and although it would be extremely dangerous for a
stranger to touch any of them, they found they could do anything with
them.  In fact, as Lucky declared, "Them dog adopt you white boys
ver' queek."

It had been the Indian's intention to start out on a reconnoitering
expedition himself the morning following Bob's adventure, but so
fierce was the storm that he knew it would be folly to attempt it.
Bob passed a good night and in the morning insisted that he was all
right and wanted to get up, but Lucky would not hear of it.

"Mebby you geet up tomorrow, mebby not.  No geet up today an' that
flat, oui."

"All right, you're the doctor," Bob laughed good naturedly, but he
chafed at the restraint.

It was still snowing hard when they went to bed that night, but Lucky
declared that the wind was working around into the west and that it
would clear before morning.  And he was right for the morning dawned
clear and cold.

"Forty below," Jack announced as he looked at the thermometer which
he had placed on the other side of the tepee.

"That's kind of chilly around the edges," Bob laughed as he pulled on
his moccasins.

He had insisted on getting up and Lucky, after a show of reluctance,
had given in.

"How much snow has fallen?" Jack asked the Indian who just then
entered the tepee.

"Heap lot.  Eet drift ver' much, but must be four feet on level.
Breakfast heem ready."

"And so are we and hungry too," Bob told him.

"You feel all right, oui?"

"Fine's a fiddle."

"No weak?"

"No weak."

"Bon."

"Bon is right," Bob smiled.

"And now what's the program?" Jack asked as soon as the meal was
finished.

"We all go find cabin?"  Lucky looked at Jack and then at Bob.

"Fine."  Both the boys spoke the word at the same time.

They left in about a half hour just as the sun was casting its first
rays into the defile.  They found the traveling extremely hard as the
snow was light and their snow-shoes sank several inches at every
step.  But they took it easy, Lucky in the lead, for he was afraid,
that, in spite of Bob's declaration, the boy had not as yet fully
recovered his strength.  It took them the better part of an hour to
reach the scene of Bob's adventure and he was unable to prevent a
shudder as he caught sight of the tree in the branches of which he
had so nearly perished.  The bodies of the wolves were, of course,
buried deep beneath the snow and there was nothing except remembrance
to recall the terrible experience.

"You tired?" Lucky asked Bob as they stopped beneath the tree.

"Little bit," Bob replied reluctantly.

"We rest leetle beet, oui?"

"Guess we better, but I'm all right."

"You feel bon, eh?"

"I sure do," Bob assured.  "Only a bit puffed."

"How far do you suppose it is to the cabin?" Jack asked.

"No can say.  Eet may be mile mebby two, mebby three.  Fellers up
here no sure of distance."

"In which respect they haven't a thing on a lot people back home,"
Jack laughed.  "Remember that farmer, Bob, up near Jackman, who told
us it was only a little over a mile to town when it was exactly four
and a half?"

"And he'd lived there all his life," Bob laughed.

After a short rest they started off again, Bob taking the lead with
strict orders from Lucky to go slow and not get tired.  Not a breath
of wind stirred the branches of the trees and not a sound save the
crunch of their snow-shoes on the dry snow.  All nature seemed at
rest and, although the sun was low in the sky, its rays had raised
the temperature noticeably since they left the camp.

"My, but it's getting real hot," Jack laughed as he took off his cap
and went through the motions of fanning himself.  "I don't believe
it's much more than thirty below."

They had stopped again for a breathing spell and Bob, in spite of his
efforts to conceal it, was breathing heavily.

"You no so strong you tink, eh?" Lucky asked anxiously.

"Oh, I'm all right only I seem to get out of wind rather easily," Bob
asserted.

"We tak' heem more easy."

"All right.  You're the boss."

"We've made about two miles don't you think?" Jack asked, turning to
Lucky.

"'Bout."

"Then I suppose we're apt to run into that cabin most any time now."

"Mebby."

But another long mile lay before them before they came to the end of
their search.  Bob was again in the lead and he suddenly stopped and
held up one hand as a signal for the others to come to a halt.

"What is it?" Jack asked as he came back to where they were standing.

"The cabin is about fifty feet from where I was," he announced in a
low tone.

"You see heem?"

"Yes."

"You see smoke come from heem chimney?"

"No, there was none."

"White boys stay here while Injun go see."

Without waiting for them to object the Indian started off and was
almost at once lost to sight amid the thick trees.

"Was it a big cabin?" Jack asked

"Not so big."

"If there was no smoke it looks as though there was no one there, I
should say."

"It sure looks that way, but I reckon we'll know before long."

In less than ten minutes they heard Lucky shout for them to come.

"That settles that part of it," Bob declared as they started.

"Sure does," Jack agreed.

In another moment they were through the fringe of trees and in plain
sight of the little cabin which stood beneath the branches of one of
the largest spruces they had ever seen.  Lucky was standing a few
feet from the door and they could see that the snow was banked nearly
half way to its top.

"And there are no tracks except his," Jack declared as they advanced.

"No one home?" Bob asked trying to conceal his disappointment.

"Non, no one home," Lucky echoed.

The three looked at each other for a full minute before anyone spoke
again.

"We must get in," Bob finally said.

"It's going to be some job to get that door open without a shovel,"
Jack declared.

"How about a window?"

"Oui, we geet in window."

There were but two windows, one on each side, and they consisted of a
single pane of glass about fourteen inches square.

"Going to be a pretty tight squeeze even if we can get it open," Bob
said as they halted after making a circuit of the cabin.

"But I reckon we can make it," Jack declared as he stepped close to
the window and began to examine it.  "It's nailed fast," he announced
a moment later.

"Think we can drive it open?" Bob asked.

"Could if we had a hammer or an axe."

"Which we haven't, but there's a pile of wood out back.  You wait a
minute till I see what I can find."

He was back shortly with two sticks of wood one about a foot long and
an inch or more thick while the other was nearly four feet long and
about three times as thick.

"Here we are," he said as he handed the small piece to Jack.  "Now,
you hold that against one corner and I'll see what I can do."

Jack did as directed and Bob began to hammer the end of the stick
with his club, gently at first and then harder as the frame showed no
sign of yielding.

"Guess they must have used spikes," he said as he paused to examine
the frame after he had struck thirty or more blows.

"Mebby better try other one," the Indian suggested.

"Not a bad idea," Bob agreed.  "Come on, Jack, perhaps that one isn't
nailed so hard."

"I'm going to get in there if I have to break the glass," Jack
declared as he followed the others around to the other side.

"I hope it won't be necessary."

"She's giving a bit," Jack shouted after Bob had been hammering away
for about five minutes.

"Good."

"Bon."

"That's enough.  I think I can push it out the rest of the way," Jack
told them after a few more blows had made a large crack between the
window frame and the sill.

"All right.  Go to it," Bob panted.

Jack pushed with all his strength and finally had the satisfaction of
forcing the window completely out.

"Now for the squeeze," he said as he laid the window down on the snow.

"Better take a good look around inside there first," Bob cautioned.

"Don't see anything to be afraid of," he announced a moment later.
"So here goes."

Jack and Lucky had little difficulty in getting in, but Bob was
thicker and with him it was indeed a tight squeeze and they had to
help him.  But finally they were all in and ready to inspect the
cabin.

To be sure the small windows admitted but little light, but they were
able to see well enough after the first few minutes.  The cabin
consisted of but a single room and was meagerly furnished.  An old
rusty cook stove in the center, a rough table and three old straight
backed chairs together with a couple of rude bunks filled with spruce
boughs about completed the inventory, with the exception of a rough
closet at one end which contained a few pots and pans and a few
cracked dishes and three or four knives, forks and spoons.  The floor
was of dirt.

"Gee, it doesn't look as though anyone had lived here for a good
while," Jack said after they had made the complete circuit of the big
room.

"It sure doesn't look promising," Bob agreed.

"Heem look ver'--what you call heem--punk," Lucky added.

"Punk is right and then some," Jack told him.

"But the place looks mighty clean," Bob declared.

"But that doesn't mean anything, does it?"

"I don't know that it does," Bob acknowledged.

"How long since anyone has been here," Jade asked, turning to the
Indian.

"No can tell."

"But you can guess."

"Mebby week, mebby year."  Lucky shook his head.

"And that's not very definite,"

"Not ver'," Lucky confessed.

All this time the Indian had been moving about examining each object
with the utmost minuteness in an effort, he explained a few minutes
later, to get a clue as to what manner of men had last occupied the
cabin and how long ago they had been there.  But he was forced to
acknowledge that it was too much for him and that he was beat.

"Injun hate geev up," he said shaking his head sadly.  "But no can
tell."

"But I've found something."

Bob was at the other end of the room from the others as he spoke and
they hastened to where he was closely examining one of the logs which
was about on a level with his shoulders.

"What is it?" Jack asked eagerly.

Bob made no reply, but pointed with his finger.

"S. L."

Jack spelled out the letters slowly and then looked at his brother.

"Well?" he asked.

"S. L. stand for Silas Lakewood, don't they?" Bob asked a bit
impatiently.

"They could, of course, but don't forget that they could also stand
for a good many other names as well.  It doesn't look to me as though
those letters were cut there very recently.  What do you say, Lucky?"

The Indian looked at the letters for a long time before he made any
reply, but he finally turned to Jack and said:

"Heap hard tell, but Injun tink them not ver' old, mebby three, mebby
four week."

"Why do you think so?" Bob asked.

"Color wood tell Injun."

"Well, I think it's a pretty safe bet that he's been here anyhow,"
Bob declared.

"But we knew that before," Jack said.  "Or at least we have that
man's word for it."

"Yes and these letters make it pretty near certain, don't you think,
Lucky?"

"Oui, heem been here."

"Granted for the sake of the argument, and now what's the next step?"

"I'll never tell you," Bob said soberly.

"It kind of looks to me as though we're at the end of our rope so to
speak," Jack declared.

"What's your opinion, Lucky?" Bob asked.

"Eet not bon--what you call heem--situation," the Indian began after
a moment of deep thought.  "We no can track heem in fresh snow,
Lightnin' heem bon tracker, but no bon here."

"But we can't give up yet," Bob told him.

"We no geeve heem up."

"Then what?"

"Mebby we wait two, three day, mebby dey come back, eh?"

"And mebby they won't," Jack added.  "But I guess that's as good a
plan as any.  What do you say, Bob?"

"I reckon it is.  To try to follow them under the circumstances would
be mere guess work unless we can find some clue on the outside."

"That's a mighty good idea.  I never thought of that," Jack said.
"Let's get at it."

"Better wait till 'nother day," Lucky advised.  "Eet geet dark time
we geet back now an' we got nothin' eat."

So, after a little discussion it was decided that they would go back
to the camp and come again early in the morning and hunt all day if
necessary for a clue.



THE ESKIMO.

"Now I reckon we'll need all the woodcraft we ever learned."

The sun was not yet up although it was after ten o'clock and they
were once more standing in front of the cabin.  The night before they
had seriously considered the plan of moving all their stuff into the
cabin and making it their headquarters, but Lucky had not been in
favor of it, pointing out that they would have to build a fire in the
stove and that the smoke would betray their presence in case the man
should return.  So the final vote had been against it.

It was Bob who made the above statement and both Jack and the Indian
readily agreed with him.

"Which way do you think they most likely went?" Jack asked looking
first at Bob and then at Lucky.

"North, I should say," Bob replied and Lucky nodded agreement.  "You
see, if they had gone south we would probably have run into them or
at least heard from them from someone who did," he explained.

"Then I reckon we'd better hunt up that way first," Jack proposed.

Both the boys, having spent a good part of their lives in the great
woods of Northern Maine, were very expert in reading the signs of the
forest and, as Jack had more than once declared, the Indian forgot
more about such things every night than they ever knew.  But in spite
of all this several hours of hard searching told them next to
nothing.  To be sure they found plenty of signs which told them that
someone had been there not many weeks previous but, as Jack put it,
there were altogether too many of them, for they found them not only
to the north, but on all other sides as well, and there was
absolutely nothing to indicate the direction they had taken when they
quit the cabin for the last time.

"Looks like a case of heads you win and tails I lose," Jack said a
bit discouragingly as they finally stopped to swallow the lunch they
had brought with them.

"Don't quite see the connection," Bob told him.

"Gray matter working a bit sluggishly today?"

"Maybe."

"Well, if we stay here we're not likely to find them and if we don't
we're not."

"Don't what?"

"Don't stay here."

"Oh.  Well, your comparison is very poor.  In fact it is not
applicable to the case in hand at all."

"Which may or may not be a matter of opinion," Jack grinned good
naturedly.

"Leesten."

The Indian suddenly held up his hand.

"Someone's coming," Bob declared a moment later.

"Queek, we geet out sight."

They were only a short distance from the cabin and it was but a
moment's work to gather up the remains of their lunch and slip around
to the other side of it.

"But they'll see our tracks," Jack said.

"Of course, but we can't help that," Bob told him.

It was but a few moments before they heard a loud voice calling on a
team of dogs to stop and Lucky whispered:

"Eet Eskimo."

"Then we might as well show ourselves," Jack suggested.

They at once stepped out from behind the cabin, the Indian in the
lead, and saw that he had been right in his estimate of the
nationality of the stranger.  He was a short fat man completely
swathed in furs and was accompanied by a team of four dogs with an
nearly empty sled.  He was busily engaged in examining their tracks
and they were within a few feet of him before he was aware of their
presence.

"How," Lucky said pleasantly as the man looked up.

"Ugh."

It was a grunt, but whether meant to be pleasant or hostile the boys
were unable to tell.

"Where you come?"

The Eskimo shook his head evidently not understanding the question.

The Indian repeated the question this time in French, but he again
shook his head at the same time saying something in a language
entirely new to the boys.  But Lucky understood him for he
immediately answered in the same language, and, for several minutes
they carried on a spirited conversation helped along by many eloquent
gestures on the part of the stranger.

"Heem say heem live three hundred mile nor' of here," Lucky told them
when the man stopped for a moment.

"Ask him if he's seen the men we're after," Bob suggested.

"Injun asked an' heem say oui, heem seen 'em."

"Where?"

"'Bout hundred mile nor'."

"How long ago?" Bob asked eagerly.

"Three day.  Heem say dey got leetle camp on Colville River."

"Have you ever been there?" Jack asked.

"Noo, Injun no go nor' more dan leetle way more."

"Ask him if he'll be our guest for the night," Bob directed.

"Heem say oui," Lucky announced as soon as he had given the
invitation and received his answer.

"Then I reckon we might as well be getting back to camp."

"Oui, we go."

They arrived back at camp just as it was getting dark and Lucky
directed the stranger to make himself at home.  The Eskimo took in
the location of the camp at a glance and then drove his dogs to a
thicket a few yards away where he quickly located them for the night.

"Heem no dare put heem dog near ours, fear dem fight," Lucky
explained.

"He seems to be a sort of a grouch," Jack declared a little later as
he noted how the stranger persisted in keeping much to himself.

"Probably he's bashful," Bob smiled.

But his shyness vanished quickly as soon as supper was ready and he
ate with great relish the food which Lucky heaped on his plate.

"Too bad we haven't any candles to offer him," Jack laughed.

"He seems to be doing very well as it is," Bob laughed back.

"I'd hate to have him for a steady boarder."

When it came time to turn in, Lucky, at Bob's suggestion, offered the
Eskimo a place in the tepee, but he declined on the ground that it
would be too warm.

"Heem say heem sleep out door, geet plenty air."

At Bob's suggestion the Indian had questioned the man further
regarding the two men they were hunting, but it seemed that he knew
no more than he had told them at first.  He had seen them as he came
by, but had stopped only to pass the time of day.

Shortly after six o'clock the following morning, Bob awoke with a
strange sense of impending disaster.  Had he heard someone prowling
about in the night or had he only dreamed if?  Careful not to disturb
the others, who were still sleeping, he wiggled out of his bag and
crept noiselessly outside.  For a moment he stood gazing into the
North where streamer after streamer sent an almost dazzling light far
up into the heavens.

"I never saw such a display of the Northern Lights," he murmured as
he gazed at the scene at most spellbound.

The fire was burning low only a few embers showing a dim light, but
it was not dark and he could see plainly for some distance.  There
was no sign of their guest and he concluded that he must have slept
over near his dogs.  Moving quietly he made his way toward the
thicket stopping every few feet to listen.  He did not want the man
to suspect that he was spying on him, but some inner sense told him
that all was not well.  And a moment later his suspicions were
strengthened when he found that both man and team were gone.

"It's strange," he thought as he looked at the place where they had
huddled together.

Then he turned and ran quickly over behind the tepee where their
stores were packed on the sled.  And now his suspicions were
confirmed.  He had heard someone prowling behind the tepee during the
night and he was disgusted with himself that he had not awakened
sufficiently to make an investigation.  Their stores had been rifled
and, it seemed to him, the greater part of them were gone.

"Jack!  Lucky!" he yelled.

There was no answer and he yelled again this time louder, and was
rewarded by a "huh" from Jack.

"Get out here and make it snappy."

"Where's the fire?" Jack asked sleepily a moment later as he poked
his head out of the tepee.

"He's gone."

"Who's gone?"

"That Eskimo."

"Well, why make such a fuss over a little thing like that?"  Jack was
out of the tepee with the Indian close behind him.

"Take a look here and you'll know," Bob snapped.

"The--the,"

"All that and some more," Bob interrupted.

"To think that he'd steal our food," Jack gasped.

"Heem one beeg thief," Lucky added.

"But we've got to have those things back.  He's taken nearly
everything we had," Bob declared after he had investigated a moment.

"Injun go geet heem."

"And we'll go with you," Jack added.

"Non," Lucky shook his head.  "Injun go faster heemself."

"You'll take the dogs?" Bob asked without arguing the point for he
knew Lucky was right.  They were no match for him when it came to
speed.

"Oui.  Tak' dog, bring back stuff."  The Indian was already hurrying
toward the dog shed and in less than five minutes he was ready to
start.

"You stay here till I come bac'," he ordered as he gave the order to
mush.

"How long do you expect to be gone?" Bob shouted after him.

"No can tell.  Be bac' as queek as can."

"And I hope it will be soon," Bob said turning to Jack.  "I'll be
mighty uneasy until he returns."

"Same here.  There was something about that guy that I didn't like a
little bit.  He had a bad eye."

"Also a bad disposition."

"Well, I hope Lucky gets him and gets the stuff back.  It'll be very
inconvenient for us to say the least if he doesn't."

"He'll do it if anyone could, and I don't imagine it will take him
very long to catch up with him as our dogs are well rested and his
must be tired."

"Not so very tired either.  Remember he's been traveling light."

"That's true too.  I wonder how long he's been gone."

"That's hard to say.  And, by the way, it's kind of strange that none
of us heard him."

"I did," Bob told him.

"You did?  Well, why in the name of common sense, didn't you stop him
or do something?" Jack demanded.

"Well, you see, I didn't get awake enough to really know that I had
heard anything.  I remember wondering if I had really heard it or had
just dreamed it.  It's too bad, of course, but there's no use crying
over spilled milk."

"Don't think I was blaming you, old man," Jack hastened to assure
him.  "It wasn't your fault.  But I'm hungry.  Let's get something to
eat if he's left us anything at all."

"Righto.  You build up the fire and I'll see what I can find."

Jack had the fire going in good shape by the time Bob was back with a
can of condensed milk and a small package.

"We'll have to make out with flapjacks," he announced.

"Is that all you could find?" Jack asked disappointedly.

"This is all he left us in the eating line.  I don't know how he came
to overlook these."

"He took all the coffee?"

"Every bit of it."

"He ought to be hanged."

"And then some."

"If he was in need of food and had taken a little I wouldn't have
blamed him so much, but to strip us clean up here in this
wilderness--well, it's little short of murder."

"You said it.  Believe me I would like to be with Lucky when he gets
him.  I'm afraid he won't do the case justice."

"Leave it to him.  I think he'll be equal to the occasion."

The flapjacks proved pretty dry eating without coffee to wash them
down, but they managed to make out with melted snow.

"What'll we do to pass the time?" Jack asked as soon as they were
finished.

"Let's go hunting," Bob suggested.  "We ought to be able to get a
deer; goodness knows we've seen plenty of tracks and we need the
food."

"Goodness knows that too," Jack laughed as he crept into the tepee
for the rifles and snow-shoes.

They struck out toward the north and had not been gone more than a
quarter of an hour when they came upon the tracks of a deer.  It was
yet dark and not for another two hours would the sun show itself, but
the moon, which was nearly full, gave sufficient light to see for a
long distance.

"They look pretty fresh," Bob announced after he had carefully
examined the tracks.

"Then I reckon we'd better follow them."

The tracks crossed their trail at right angles and led up the side of
the mountain to their right.  At this point, however, the assent was
not steep and, although they plunged at once into thick woods, they
found the going easier than they had expected.

"He's sinking in pretty deep," Jack said as they hurried along.

"Yes, we ought to catch up with him before long unless the tracks are
older than I think."

They had been climbing for the better part of an hour when the tracks
turned and lead parallel with the side of the mountain.  At first
they welcomed the change in direction, thinking that it would be
easier but, before they had gone a hundred yards farther, they found
themselves on a part of the mountain where it was much steeper and,
owing to the slant, it was extremely difficult to keep their balance.
But they went on as rapidly as possible, now and then falling
headlong in the snow as a shoe slipped and threw them off their
balance.  But they each time picked themselves up with a laugh and
hurried on confident that they must soon sight their quarry.

"Look over there," Bob said as he paused and pointed toward the east.

"It's beautiful," Jack declared as he watched the edge of the sun,
looking like a huge ball of fire, creeping over the top of the
opposite mountain.  "But there's something even more beautiful just
at present," he whispered a moment later as he clutched Bob's arm and
pointed to a spot about a hundred feet in front.

There, on a slight rise in the ground, stood a magnificent buck
facing them.  The animal stood up to its knees in the snow and did
not seem at all afraid.

"Isn't he a beauty?" Bob whispered.

"It's a shame to shoot him," Jack replied.  "But we've got to have
the meat so let's get it over with."

Raising their rifles they took careful aim and both fired at the same
time.  The deer fell in its tracks and never moved.

"He had an easy death at any rate," Bob said as they went toward it.

"He's too big to carry in whole so we'll have to cut him up here."

Both boys knew how to dress a deer as they had many times hunted in
the Maine woods and, in the course of an hour, they had selected the
choicest pieces and hung the rest well up in the branches of a tree
where it would be out of the reach of the wolves.

"So far so good," Jack said as they were fixing the meat so that they
could fasten it to their backs.  "Now if we get back all right and
find that Lucky has returned without stuff--"

"Hold on there," Bob interrupted.  "Don't tempt providence too far
with your ifs."

"Well, there's nothing like being optimistic as I've heard you say
many a time."

"Up to a certain point."

"And I reckon you think I'd reached that point," Jack laughed.

When they were ready to start each boy had nearly fifty pounds of
meat strapped to his back and the load made traveling doubly hard as
they soon found.  But their success had made them again light hearted
and they did not mind the hard work.

"I reckon Lucky'll be some surprised when he sees us come in with all
this meat," Jack said when they were about half way back to where the
trail had turned.

"If he's back," Bob reminded him.

"Don't you think he'll be back by the time we get there?"

"I doubt it."

"Well, here's hoping."

It was about one o'clock when they reached the place where the trail
had turned and both agreed that they had better take a rest before
starting down the mountain.

"I don't know how you feel about it, but I'm all in," Jack panted as
he unslung his pack.

"Same here," Bob agreed.  "That was about as hard a tramp as I ever
took."

They rested for a half hour and then started off again Jack taking
the lead.  They had taken but a few steps when Bob spoke to him and
in turning his head to reply Jack carelessly tripped himself and
pitched headlong into the snow.  It was by no means the first time it
had happened and Bob broke into a roar of laughter.  But the mirth
died on his lips as he heard Jack utter a loud groan.

"What's the matter?" he cried as he hurried forward.

"Afraid I've sprained or broken my ankle," he groaned.

"Maybe it's not so bad as you think," Bob encouraged as he put his
hands beneath his shoulders and helped him to get to his feet.

But Jack sank down again with a low moan of pain.

"I can't do it," he groaned.

"Let me have a look at it."

Bob unfastened the thongs which held the foot to the snow-shoe and
carefully unlaced the moccasin.

"Am I hurting?" he asked.

"Some, but it doesn't matter."

By the time he had drawn off the heavy sock the ankle had swollen
somewhat and, as carefully as possible, he examined it.  First aid to
the injured had been taught them at the military college and both
boys knew not a little about such injuries.

"Pretty sore, eh?"

"Some."

"I'm pretty sure it's not broken, but it looks like a pretty bad
sprain and that's almost as bad," he announced as he started to draw
on the sock.

"What'll we do?"

"Get back as soon as possible."

"But--but I can't walk."

"Of.  course you can't, but I reckon I can carry you."

"Not down this mountain you can't."

"I'm going to anyhow."

Seeing that his brother was determined Jack made no further objection
and, as soon as Bob had cached the two packs of meat in the branches
of a nearby tree, he set about getting ready for the start.

"You'll never make it."

"Don't you believe it."

It was hard work getting the injured boy onto his back without
hurting him, but finally it was accomplished and, as Jack declared,
without hurting a bit.

"Now you take it easy," he cautioned as Bob took the first step.

Even he had not fully realized how hard it would be.  The extra
weight caused his snow-shoes to sink much deeper in the snow and
going down hill made each shoe push itself forward into the snow thus
rendering it very difficult to lift it up for the next step.  But he
knew that it had to be done.  With the temperature nearly thirty
degrees below zero and getting lower all the time as he thought, he
knew it would be death to leave him for any length of time.

"Rest awhile," Jack begged after they had covered a few rods.

"I'm all right for a bit yet."

"Better do as I say."

"In a minute."

It was not much over the stated time when he was obliged to put him
down.

"Jack, heem heap heavy, as Lucky would say," he panted as he
carefully lowered him to the trunk of a fallen tree.

"I thought you'd find you'd bit off a bit more'n you could chew."

"Not a bit of it and that's three bits in two sentences.  I didn't
say I could carry you all the way in one jump."

"Well, take as many as you like."

"Does the foot hurt?"

"Not much: kind of a dull ache, but I'm afraid it's swelling some."

"No doubt of it and it'll continue to swell for some time yet."

He made the foot of the mountain in the next spell but was obliged to
rest again before going farther.

"It'll be a lot easier now we're on level ground," he panted.

"If only I was one of those skinny fellows now it wouldn't be so hard
on you."

"You're all right just as you are, that is all but your ankle."

Bob was resolved to make camp without stopping again, knowing that
the sooner he got Jack where he could treat the injured ankle with
hot water the better it would be.  So he took as short a rest as he
dared and, despite Jack's protests, he was soon on the go again.  As
he had said it was easier now, but it seemed as though every muscle
in his body was at the breaking point when finally he carefully
lowered him onto the boughs in the tepee.

"Now I'll get a fire going and heat some water as soon as I can," he
assured him.  "Is it hurting much?"

"Not bad."

"I'll bet it is just the same," Bob muttered under his breath as he
hurried out of the tepee.

He had a fire going in a few minutes, but it took considerable time
before the water was boiling hot.

"Now then," he said cheerfully as he re-entered the tepee with a
kettle of the steaming water.

"Didn't take you long."

"It seemed a long time to me.  I thought the water would never come
to a boil," Bob told him as he began to unlace the moccasin.  "Yell
if I hurt you."

"Don't be afraid.  I'll yell all right."

When he had removed the sock he found that the ankle had swelled to
an alarming extent and he could not repress a sigh.

"Rather bad isn't it?" Jack asked.

"It's not so good and that's a fact."

"I thought it was swelling pretty fast."

Wringing out a towel in the water he bound it as tightly as Jack
could stand about the ankle.

"You got it hot all right," Jack grinned.

"The hotter the better just so it doesn't burn."

"Guess I can stand it."

For an hour he continued the treatment changing the towel as soon as
it became cool and putting on a hot one and, at the end of that time,
had the great satisfaction of knowing that the swelling had subsided
considerably.

"There, I reckon we'll have to let nature take its course," he said
as he finished.

"Isn't it about time Lucky's getting back?" Jack asked.

"Great Scott, I haven't given him a thought since we got back.  Let's
see, it's just one o'clock and I hardly expect him before dark.  Now,
I'll get us a bite of flapjacks and then I must go back and bring in
that meat."

"Won't it be safe till morning?"

"Maybe, but a venison steak will go pretty good for supper tonight,
don't you think?"

"I reckon, but you're too tired to go way back there."

"Tired your grandmother.  I'll be back almost before you know I'm
gone.  It isn't far."

By a quarter of two they had eaten of the scanty fare and Bob was
ready to start.

"I'll leave your rifle right here by your side," he said.  "Now don't
you move that foot while I'm gone and I'll be back just as soon as I
can make it."

"Don't kill yourself.  I'll be all right."

"Good bye, then."  Bob bent and kissed his brother's cheek.

"You're the best in the world," Jack told him as he shook his hand.



LUCKY BRINGS BACK THE "BACON."

Although Bob had tried hard to conceal his fears he had been much
worried since Lucky had left them.  To be sure he had unbounded
confidence in the Indian, but he also realized that he was not
infallible and he had little doubt regarding the character of the
Eskimo who had stolen their food.  Any man who would do a thing of
that sort would not be likely to hesitate at even murder were his
safety threatened.  Should anything happen to prevent his return they
would be in a pretty desperate situation especially now that Jack was
helpless.

These thoughts filled his mind as he started off, but he whistled a
merry tune until he knew he was out of hearing.

"I do hope he'll be back when I return," he said half aloud.

He found the packs of meat as he had left them and decided to leave
one where it was as he was, in spite of his assurance in Jack's
presence, pretty tired and fifty pounds was about all he cared to lug
back under the circumstances.

"The rest'll be safe enough," he thought as he slung the pack to his
back.

Although it was not yet three o'clock when he stumbled into camp,
tired through and through, darkness had fallen.  He had started
whistling as soon as he knew that he was in hearing distance and
Jack's voice, as he shouted a welcome, assured him that all was well
so far as he was concerned.

"Lucky's not back yet," he said as he swung the pack to the ground
and entered the tepee.

"Not yet."

"Oh, well, he's likely to come any minute now," he said trying to
speak cheerfully.  "How's the foot?"

"The patient is doing as well as could be expected."

"Hurt much?"

"Not much.  But you must be about played out."

"Not so you'd notice it.  Think you can masticate a good juicy steak?"

"Lead me to it, or rather lead it to me."

There was still a good bed of coals and in a very few minutes Bob had
a huge steak sizzling in the frying pan.

"Thank goodness he didn't take both bags of salt," he said to himself
as he found a small sack of the precious material which the thief had
overlooked.  "Now, if he'd only left us a few spuds it wouldn't be so
bad, but perhaps Lucky'll be back with them by the time the steak's
ready."

But he was not and they had to eat it straight, as Jack put it.
However hunger is an excellent sauce and the thick juicy steak,
cooked to a turn, went down with no urging.

"Best thing I ever tasted," Jack declared after he had eaten all he
could manage.

"Not half bad, but I do wish Lucky'd come."

"If wishes were horses, you know," Jack quoted.

"Yes, I know.  But he ought to be getting along."

Although Jack objected strenuously Bob insisted on giving the ankle
another hot water treatment and it was close to six o'clock when he
had finished, and the Indian had not returned.

"Something's gone wrong with Lucky," Jack declared.

"I hardly think so.  You see, there's no telling how far he had to
chase him and you know Lucky."

"And we don't know that Eskimo.  There's the rub."

"But--"

"Honest Injun, now, aren't you worried?"

"Sure I am, but I honestly think he'll come back all right."

"How long do you think this old ankle will lay me up?"

"A week maybe."

"A week, your grandmother's eye.  Bet you I walk on it tomorrow."

"Maybe, but I doubt it."

During the past half hour Bob had been conscious that the wind was
rising steadily and the fact caused him no little uneasiness.  If
they should have another blizzard before the Indian returned it would
make their lot doubly hard.  As he went outside to replenish the fire
he cast an anxious eye upward and his fears were increased when he
was unable to see any stars.

"I believe it's going to snow again," he muttered as he threw a big
log on the fire.

As he again looked up a flake of snow struck his face and he turned
back and entered the tepee with a sinking heart.

"How's the weather?" Jack asked.

"Not so good."

"Snowing?"

"Starting a bit."

"I thought that wind sounded like it."

"Perhaps it won't amount to anything."

"Storms usually don't up here," Jack said sarcastically.

"But this one may be an exception."

"Maybe.  But, honest Injun, Bob, we're in rather a bad fix, don't you
think?"

"Bad, but not desperate.  We've got food enough, thanks to that buck,
to last a good while so we won't starve and, thank goodness, we had
sense enough to keep our ammunition in the tepee so he didn't get
away with that.  I don't see that we're in any great danger."

"Well, you'd better put that light out.  All the oil we have left is
in those two lanterns."

Bob blew out the light and for a long time they sat in the darkness
and talked.  The temperature had risen during the past few hours and
the heat reflected from the fire, which Bob kept going, made it very
comfortable in the snug tepee.  Each did his best to appear cheerful
but each knew that the other was far more anxious that he let on.
While they knew that they were in no great danger the thought that
their friend might be lying dead or wounded somewhere out in the
storm made the situation almost unbearable.  Several times Bob had
been out to replenish the fire and each time he reported that it was
snowing.  To be sure the storm had not as yet reached the height of a
blizzard, but each time he went out he realized that the wind was
stronger and the snow was coming down faster.

"It's ten o'clock," he announced.  "Shall we hit the hay?"

"Might's well I reckon.  He won't be back tonight."

Bob lit the lantern and helped Jack get into his sleeping bag.  Then
he went out and fixed the fire so that it would last for several
hours.

"It's going to be a blizzard all right," he muttered as he crept back
into the tepee and into his sleeping bag.

He blew out the light and for several moments there was silence and
each boy knew that the other was in communication with Him who is
conscious of the sparrow's fall.

Although very tired it was long before Bob slept.  Over and over
again he asked himself what could have happened to Lucky, and as
often came the thought that it must have been something very serious
or he would have returned.  He could tell by the sound of Jack's
breathing that he was asleep and he was glad.  That the storm was
increasing in violence he knew and the knowledge that it might last
for days added to his worry.  Finally he was almost off when the
faint, but unmistakable howl of a wolf, far off on the mountain side,
brought him wide awake.

"One would think we had trouble enough without that," he thought.

But second thought convinced him that they really had little to fear
from wolves.  The fire would keep them away and even though they
should brave that they had their guns and plenty of ammunition.  So
he put that thought from his mind and soon was asleep.  How long he
slept he did not know, but it must have been several hours for he
could not see the reflection from the fire as he reached out and
pulled aside a branch from one of the thick boughs.  The wind was
howling with almost demoniacal fury and, as he listened a moment,
above the noise of the storm came the dismal howl of a wolf and he
knew that the animal must be near.

"Was that a wolf?" Jack cried as he caught hold of Bob's arm.

"Guess so."

"What time is it?"

"Five o'clock," Bob told him after a glance at the luminous dial of
his wrist watch.

"Reckon the fire's about out, isn't it?"

"Must be.  I'll go out and build it up."

"Think its safe?" Jack asked as another howl reached their ears.

"Sure.  They're not that near and I'll take my gun."

"But--"

But Bob was already out of his bag and creeping from the tepee and
what Jack said was lost in the fury of the storm.  As soon as he was
on his feet he saw that only a small bed of coals remained of the
fire.

"And the snow would have put them out if it wasn't for the protection
of that cliff," he thought as he hurried to where they had piled the
supply of wood.  "I'll have to get in some more wood tomorrow
whatever happens," he muttered as he noted the small amount left.

The fire was so low that it took him some little time to get it to
blazing again, but he finally accomplished it with the aid of some
light stuff and had turned to get more when an angry snarl caused him
to glance over the fire.  There, about thirty feet from where he
stood, but plainly visible in the light of the fire, was the largest
wolf he had ever seen.  It was evident that the great beast feared
the blaze and dared not approach nearer, but it was also clear that
it was loath to retreat.  So it stood there baring its cruel fangs
and uttering snarl after snarl.

Bob had stood his rifle against a tree only three or four feet from
where he was and in another instant it was in his hand and he was
pressing the trigger.  Had it been daylight it would have been an
easy shot but the flickering fire must have disturbed his aim for the
wolf, with an angry snarl, either of rage or pain, he was not sure
which, turned and bounded off into the forest.

"Missed him," Bob groaned in disgust.

"Did you get him?"

He barely caught the words.

"No, I missed him, but he's gone."

"Hurry up, he may be back."

"There's no danger.  I'll be in in a minute."

But it was some time before he had the fire going to his satisfaction
and he would not leave it before.  He could hear, now and then, the
snarl or howl of the beasts and knew that there must be quite a
number of them around but, although he kept close watch, he saw no
more and, finally, he crept back into the tepee.

"Many of them?" Jack asked anxiously.

"There's a few, but the fire'll keep them off."

"How'd you miss?"

"Reckon the fire threw my aim off.  It was a good shot."

"Didn't you hit him at all?"

"I don't know.  He sounded as though he was kinder disappointed."

"Probably had his mind made up for a good meal," Jack chuckled.

"Well, he isn't going to get it off us," Bob assured him.

"You go to sleep and I'll wake you if there's any need."

"What's the matter with the other way around?"

"No, you need it and I don't.  You've been doing all the work and may
have to do it all for a day or two longer if this bum ankle of mine
gets to cutting up."

"How does it feel?"

"Pretty good.  But will you do as I say?"

"I would if I could, but the sleep's all knocked out of me and I
couldn't go to sleep if my life depended on it."

"All right then, we'll talk."

"You'd better sleep."

"Couldn't do it."

"You mean it?"

"Sure do.  I'm not a bit sleepy."

"All right, I'll be glad of your company."

"How's the storm?"

"It's still snowing."

"Hard as ever?"

"I'm afraid so but, to tell the truth, I didn't pay much attention to
it."

"It doesn't seem to be blowing quite so hard."

When Bob's watch told him it was seven o'clock he declared that he
was going to get breakfast wolves or no wolves.

"I haven't heard them for the last half hour and they've probably
gone," he told Jack.

The wind was still blowing a gale and the snow was driving with
unbated fury outside, but within the fringe of trees it was not so
bad and, after he had replenished the fire with almost the last of
the wood, he got the meat from where he had hung it in a tree and cut
off two thick steaks.  Then he melted some snow and mixed up a batch
of flapjacks with the water as the condensed milk was all gone.

"Venison steak and flapjacks," he announced a half hour later as he
brought the food in to Jade.  "What more could you want?"

"A cup of coffee."

"That would go good, but we'll have to make out without it this
morning, I reckon."

After they had eaten, Bob made an examination of the injured ankle
and was gratified to find that the swelling had nearly vanished.

"Is it very sore?" he asked.

"Not so very.  Let's see if I can stand on it."

"Better wait a bit."

"But--"

"No buts.  You'll only injure it if you tax it now."

Jack knew that Bob was speaking the truth and did not press the point.

"Don't you think, Bob, that you ought to go hunt for Lucky?" he asked
a little later.

"And leave you here?"

"I'd be all right."

"I'm not so sure about that."

"But the wolves have gone and they're not likely to return very soon."

"Well, I've got to get some more wood in first anyhow, so we won't
decide till that's done and perhaps he'll be back then."

The sun would not be up for another two hours or more, but it was not
so dark that he felt obliged to wait.  But once outside the fringe of
trees where the full strength of the storm struck him, he doubted his
ability to accomplish his purpose.  But he knew that there was plenty
of dead wood where they had been working before and it was only a
short distance away.  At every step he sank nearly to his waist and,
before he had gone twenty feet, he decided he had better go back and
put on his snow-shoes.  Fortunately the wind was directly in his face
and he knew that, although it took about all his strength to make
headway against it, it would be of great help when it came to
dragging the wood back.

"I'd never be able to drag much of a stick against this wind," he
muttered.

He remembered a large spruce which had fallen a little to the right
of where they had obtained the wood before and which they had not
touched and he felt sure that, could he but find it, he could get
enough to at least last through the day and the next night.

He located the tree without much trouble and was glad to see that the
snow was not quite up to the trunk.  This made it comparatively easy
to chop off the thick branches and he set to work after standing his
rifle, which he had not dared to leave behind, against the butt of
the tree.  He forced himself to work with exceeding care as he well
knew the danger of a slip of the axe under the circumstances and
should he cut himself they would be in a plight ten times more
serious than at present.  When he judged that he had cut as much as
he could drag he hastened the butts of the branches together with a
piece of rope and, picking up his rifle, started back.  It was only a
little over a hundred feet back to the fire, but he was all but
winded by the time he got there with his load.

"Coming along fine," he shouted sticking his head into the tepee
before starting back for a second load.

"How's the storm?" Jack asked.

"Still humming."

"No sign of a let up?"

"Not yet."

While working Bob had been trying to make up his mind what he ought
to do.  Lucky was undoubtedly in trouble and he felt that he ought to
go to his aid in case he could find him.  Then, on the other hand,
was his duty to his brother.  Would it be safe to leave him in his
present condition?  Suppose the wolves should come back while he was
gone and make an attack on him.  He shuddered as he thought what
might result in case he was not able to keep them off.  Then again,
suppose something should happen to him and he be unable to get back.
Jack would surely die and again a shudder ran through him.  It was a
situation which sorely taxed his mind, and he was unable to decide
where his duty lay.

He had dragged in his third load and was back at the tree and about
to start cutting again when he heard a sound which sent the blood
racing through his body.  At first he thought it was a wolf and then,
as it came again, he knew he had been mistaken.

"That's Lightning, or I'm a Dutchman," he cried as he put his hands
up to his mouth and gave a loud yell.

The yell was answered almost at once in the welcome tones of Lucky's
voice and for an instant Bob raised his eyes and thanked God.  Then,
grabbing up his rifle, he hastened back and burst through the fringe
of trees just as the dog team swept around the farther end.

"Thank God," he cried and the next minute he was hugging the Indian
as though he never intended to let him go.

"Whar Jack?" the Indian asked as soon as he could speak.

"I'm in here," Jack called out.

"He sprained his ankle yesterday," Bob explained.

"Dat bad, but I tank Le Bon Dieu you safe."

By this time he was inside the tepee where he received a welcome
fully as warm as Bob's.

"Did you get the stuff?" Jack asked after a bit.

"Oui, I geet heem."

"But what made you gone so long?"

"That can wait, Jack," Bob broke in.  "Can't you see he's tired and
hungry?"  Then, turning to the Indian, he said: "Now you lie down
here in your bag and I'll see to the dogs and get you something to
eat."

But the Indian would not hear to it insisting that he was all right
although he acknowledged that he was pretty hungry.

"Then you see to the dogs and I'll get you something to eat.  We got
a buck yesterday and I reckon you can get outside a good sized steak."

"Oui, I eat heem ver' quick."

Bob had the steak cooking in almost no time and Lucky declared that
it was the best thing he had ever eaten.  As soon as he had finished
they went inside the tepee where Jack was waiting impatiently.

"Thought you'd never come," he growled.

"Now, Lucky, tell us all about it."

"Oui, Injun tell.  Injun geet up with heem leetle past noon.  Heem
goin' ver' fast, but Injun's dog heem go faster, oui.  Heem no hear
me till I geet most up to heem.  Then heem see an' mak' to draw gun,
but Injun have gun out an' Injun tell heem hand up or heem geet keel
queek.

"And I'll bet he put 'em up in a hurry," Jack said as Lucky paused.

"Oui, heem put um up."

"Then what?" Bob asked as he paused again.

"Injun come close an' mak' heem put stuff back on sled.  Heem ver'
mad' an' watch ver' close chance to geet--what you call um--drop, but
heem no geet."

"I'll bet he didn't."

"Keep still and let him tell the story," Bob ordered.

"When heem stuff all put on my sled Injun tell heem start off ver'
queek.  Tell heem no look back an heem ver' glad go heem see heem no
geet drop on Injun.  Injun watch heem till heem geet long ways off
an' then Injun turn heem dog around an' we start back."

"What time was that?" Bob asked.

"Now, who's interrupting?" Jack demanded.

"Eet 'bout ein o'clock.  All go bon till we geet most half way back
an' then that Slack dog heem geet seek, ver' seek, an' we have stop.
Injun no know what matter with dog.  Heem act like heem got belly
ache ver' bad.  Got no medicine so have to rub heem belly ver' long
time an' tink mebby heem goin' die.  Injun no want dog die, dey too
bon dog.  So keep on rubbin' an' when eet begin geet dark dog begin
geet better, but heem still some seek.  So put heem on sled an'
start, but een leetle while Pete dog heem geet seek and have stop rub
heem long time.  When heem geet better have go ver' slow an' begin
snow, have go slow some more.  No geet here till leetle while ago.
But Injun geet here."

"You bet you did," Jack burst out.

"How ankle?  Heem ver' bad?"

"It's coming along fine now.  Reckon I can walk on it tomorrow."

"I'm not so sure about that," Bob said with a shake of his head.

"How long's this storm going to last, Lucky?" Jack asked.

"No can tell.  Mebby not ver' long."

"I don't see why it doesn't make a continuous performance of it and
be done with it.  Then one would know what to expect," Jack growled.

"Don't be pessimistic," Bob advised.  "Now that Lucky's back we can
stand a little snow, I reckon."

"A little, yes, but who said anything about a little?"

"Well, a lot then."

"That's a lot better."

"You no walk on that foot tomorrow I tink."

"But I could ride for awhile and we could go slow."

"Mebby, eef snow not too mooch.  We see mornin' heem come."

It seemed good to have a variety of food once more and they made a
bit of a feast of the dinner opening a number of things which they
had been saving for some special occasion.  In the short afternoon
they cut some more wood and dragged it in and as darkness was falling
the storm showed signs of breaking.

"Eet be bon day tomorrow," Lucky announced while they were eating
supper.

"Then we'll be off," Jack declared.

"Mebby, see how um foot be in morning."



VISITORS.

As Lucky had predicted the storm blew itself out during the night and
the stars were shining in a clear sky when they ate breakfast shortly
after seven o'clock.

"How um foot feel?" Lucky asked when the meal was over.

"Fine's a fiddle," Jack assured him and to convince him that he was
telling the truth he took a few steps with only a slight limp.

"You no can walk on foot today.  Mebby tomorrow, oui."

"Sure I can.  Why it doesn't hurt hardly any."

"Lucky's right, old man, and you know it.  As long as it hurts at all
it would be foolish to think of trying to walk on snow-shoes," Bob
added.

"But couldn't I ride on the sled?" Jack asked.

"No can do.  Too mooch snow mak' eet too hard for dog.  Eet keel um."

"Well, of course, I don't want to do anything like that, but I sure
do hate to be wasting time here.  By the time we get up there we'll
probably find they've left for the North Pole."

"Then it'll be the North Pole for us," Bob chuckled.

During the day Jack growled off and on at the enforced delay although
he knew that the Indian was quite right.  But the ankle was improving
rapidly, thanks to Bob's treatment, and he was resolved that it
should not keep them from starting out the next morning.

The next morning came at last and, although the Indian shook his head
and Bob advised waiting over another day, Jack insisted that the
ankle would stand it and, against their better judgment, they finally
gave in.

"You no keep on that ankle heem hurt," Lucky ordered as, shortly
after eight o'clock, they were all ready to go.  "That ankle heem no
strong an' you hurt heem some more mebby you no use heem again for
ver' long time."

The weather had continued warmer than was usual and the snow, which
had been heavy when it fell, had settled rapidly and was so well
packed in most places that the dogs sank in but a little and the sled
hardly at all.

"Eet ver' bon snow-shoen'," Lucky said after they were fairly on the
way.

"You bet," Bob replied.  Then, turning to Jack, he asked: "Does that
ankle hurt any?"

"Nothing to speak of," Jack assured him.  "Of course, I know I've got
one."

"You tak' heem easy.  I tink snow packed 'nough so you can ride some
on sled when you geet tired," Lucky told him.

"I'll let you know when I want to ride," Jack assured them.

The Indian had set a slow pace, knowing that Jack would not be able
to maintain a fast one for any length of time, and it was nearly ten
o'clock when they reached the scene of the accident and retrieved the
meat which Bob had cached there.

Lucky had estimated that they had made about twenty-five miles when
they stopped for the night shortly after five o'clock.  It had been
dark for several hours, but not dark enough to prevent them from
traveling.  Jack had rode a good part of the way although he had
protested strongly every time Lucky or Bob had proposed it, and his
ankle was in fairly good shape although he confessed that "it didn't
feel as good as new."

"But another night's rest will fix it all right," he assured them.

All day their way had led through the defile between the two ranges
of mountains and, for the most part, they had been ascending although
at no time had the way been at all steep.  They were off to an early
start the next morning resolved to make a long day of it, provided
Jack's ankle permitted, and when the sun showed itself over the top
of the mountain, Lucky declared they had covered not less than
fifteen miles.  Jack had walked nearly all the time, resorting to the
sled only a couple of times and then only for short distances.

Shortly after noon they emerged from the defile and found, stretching
out before them and sloping gently downward, an unbroken waste of
snow reaching as far as they could see.

"Great Scott!" Bob burst out.  "How are we ever going to keep a
straight course across all that?"

"We ought to have a compass," Jack added.

"Mebby heem not so far heem look," Lucky told them.  "Eet ver' what
you call hazy.  Mebby not ver' far 'cross."

"Here's hoping," Bob told him.

His hope was realized for just as it was beginning to get dark they
sighted a thick growth of trees and in another hour they were once
more traveling through woods.

"Are you sure we're on the right trail, Lucky?" Bob asked anxiously.

"Oui.  I tink so.  Eskimo heem tell me whar go."

"But how do you know that he was telling the truth.  Any man who
would do what he did wouldn't hesitate to lie."

"Mebby heem lie."

"Well, I suppose the only way to find out is to keep on."

"Oui, that only way."

How the Indian could keep anything like a straight course through the
deep forest, in which they were now traveling, and where he had never
been before, was a mystery to the boys.  But he never hesitated as he
led the way and they knew they were making good time.  It was about
half past five when he finally called a halt for the night and both
boys were glad to hear the order, Jack especially as his ankle, which
was still far from being strong, had been giving him considerable
pain during the last hour.

"We mak' eet tomorrow, mebby," Lucky told them as he set about making
the dogs comfortable for the night.

The temperature had been falling ever since morning and now the
mercury in their thermometer stood thirty degrees below zero and was
still falling.

"It's going to be a bit cold around the edges tonight," Bob declared
as he took the axe and started to hunt for firewood.

"Bet she'll go to forty," Jack agreed.

"How cold you ever know it to get up here, Lucky?" he asked a little
later as they were sitting around the fire eating supper.

"'Bout feefty-five, mebby seexty."

"Well, I hope it doesn't break that record while we're up here," Bob
laughed.

They reached Colville River soon after dark the following day and
made camp in a thick clump of trees close to the bank.

"Wonder if there's any fish in this river?" Jack asked.

"I 'spect um thar, but you find eet plenty hard work cut hole een
ice," Lucky told him.

"Do you fellows want some fresh fish for supper enough to do the work
here while I'm trying to get some?"

"Go to it," Bob told him.

If he had realized what it meant to get a hole through the ice it is
doubtful if Jack would have proposed fish for supper, but once
started he was resolved not to give up.  But it was all of an hour
and a half from the time he started before he was ready to drop in
his line.  However he felt amply repaid when he carried six good
sized salmon back to camp.

"You got 'em," Bob greeted him.

"Sure did, but I thought I'd hit the bottom of the river before I
struck water," Jack told him.

"How thick is the ice?"

"Must be nearly three feet and there's about four feet of snow on top
of that."

"Well, you ought to have a medal."

The fish proved a very welcome addition to their rations and they had
a good, if a rather late, supper.

"Do we go up or down from here?" Bob asked a little later.

"Up," Lucky replied.

"But have you any idea how far from here they are?"

"Not mooch.  That man heem say only leetle way from whar we strike
river."

"Then we ought to find them tomorrow?"

"Mebby.  No can tell."

Lucky and Bob had dug a hole in the snow and had covered the bottom
with an extra thick layer of spruce boughs as the night bid fair to
be the coldest they had yet encountered.  The sleeping room, as Jack
dubbed it, was long enough to permit a good sized fire to be built at
one end and, as the walls were nearly five feet high, it was really
cozy by the time they were ready to turn in.

"Forty-eight below," Bob announced as he glanced at the thermometer
just before crawling into his bag.

"I should worry," Jack, who had been "in bed" for some moments,
chuckled.

Jack was a sound sleeper and seldom awoke during the night unless
disturbed.  But this night it seemed to him that he had hardly fallen
asleep when he awoke with a sudden start.  For a moment he lay
wondering what had happened.  He could hear Bob breathing steadily on
one side of him while the Indian was snoring quietly on the other,
and knew they were both sleeping.  The fire had died down to a bed of
coals by which he knew that he had been asleep for some hours at
least.  He was about to shut his eyes again, convinced that he had
awakened without cause, when a low threatening growl reached his ears.

"That's Lightning," he thought as he strained his ears again.

For some moments he heard no other sound and drowsiness was stealing
over him when the sharp snap of a twig brought him wide awake.
Reaching over he touched his brother lightly.

"S-s-s-s-h.  Listen," he whispered.

"What is it?" Bob breathed.

"There's something or someone out there."

"I don't hear a thing," Bob whispered.

"Listen."

"I hear it now," as another twig snapped, answered by an angry snarl
from one of the dogs which awoke Lucky.

"What matter with dog?" he whispered as soon as he saw that the boys
were awake.

"There's something prowling around the camp," Bob told him.

"Injun go see."

"Reckon we'd better all go," Bob said as he began to squirm out of
his bag.

There was only a small rim of the moon showing, but the sky was
filled with stars and it was not dark.  In fact Bob could see for
some distance through the woods as he carefully raised his eyes over
the edge of the snow.  At first he saw nothing to cause him any
alarm, but after a moment of watching he caught sight of a shadowy
form stealing from behind a large tree about thirty feet away to the
security of another some ten feet nearer.

"It's a man," he whispered.  "And there's another and another," he
added a moment later.

The dogs were now growling almost continually.

"What'll we do?" Jack whispered.

"We wait, see what um do," Lucky whispered back.

"How many have you seen?"

"Six so far," Bob whispered, and a moment later added: "They're
working around where the dogs are."

"That no go," Lucky growled.  "Mebby um keel dog."

As he spoke the Indian leaped to the edge of the snow and shouted:

"Who you, eh?"

For a moment there was silence broken only by the snarls of the dogs,
then, from behind a tree, only about ten feet from where he stood,
stepped a man.  The boys could see that it was a man of large frame
standing well over six feet, but it was not light enough to guess at
his nationality until he spoke.

"Who you?"

"He's a breed," Bob whispered in Jack's ear.

"What you want in night here?" Lucky snapped the question in a tone
they had never before heard him use.

"You name Lareux?" the man asked ignoring Lucky's question.

"Non."

"What ees eet?"

"Hogan, Lucky Hogan."

"Dat sound Irish.  You Irish?  You no talk Irish."

"No Irish.  Me Injun."

"Your name Irish, you talk lik' breed an' say you Injun.  Eet too
mooch.  You step out here whar I geet good look.  You try funny
beesness an' my man heem shoot."

For an moment Lucky hesitated as though trying to make up his mind
whether or not to obey the order.

"Go ahead, Lucky," Bob whispered.  "I've got him covered."

"My man heem got you on de sight," Lucky said as he took a few steps
forward in the deep snow.

The other, who was on snow-shoes, advanced to meet him and in a
moment they were close together.  The stranger carried a rifle, but
he bore it over his shoulder as though he had no idea of using it at
present.  On his snow-shoes he towered nearly two feet above Lucky.

"You no Lareux," the boys heard him say.

"Who heem?" Lucky asked.

"Heem ver' bad mans.  Heem keel one of my mans an' we hunt heem."

"When heem keel heem?"

"Tree, mebby four day ago," the stranger answered somewhat evasively
Bob thought.

"Where you leeve, eh?" Lucky asked after a pause of a moment.

"Up nor'."

"How far?"

"What for you ask question so mooch?"  It was plain that the man was
rapidly loosening his patience of which he probably had no great
store.

"You ask first," Lucky told him pleasantly.

"Dat my beesness."

"Mine too."

"How many mans you got?"

"Some.  How many you?"

"You see some man yes'day?" the stranger next asked without replying
to the question.

"Non."

"Day 'fore dat?"

"Non."

"All right.  We go now.  You no man we want."

He turned and stole silently back into the forest and the boys could
see others slipping from behind trees and following him.

"What do you make of it?" Bob asked as soon as the Indian was back in
the "bed room."

For a moment Lucky hesitated.

"Injun no like dat man," he finally said.

"You think he's no good?"

"Mebby.  Injun tink heem--what you call heem?--one beeg bluff."

"You mean you think he was after us and not that man he mentioned?"

"Oui."

"Then why did he leave?"

"Heem heap big coward.  Heem no know how many here."

"You think he'll come back?"

"Mebby.  No can tell."

"Well, it's after three o'clock now.  I reckon we'd better keep an
eye open, eh?"

"Injun watch.  White boys go sleep."

But both declared they had had enough sleep and could not go to sleep
again anyway, so they built up the fire and, for the next two hours
the Indian entertained them with his stories of which he seemed to
have an inexhaustable supply.  But every few minutes one or the other
would get up and take a look around, not that they thought it at all
likely that they would return so soon, but they wanted to be on the
safe side.

"How about eats?" Bob asked when his watch told him that it was
nearly six o'clock.

"You wait leetle minute," Lucky said as he got to his feet.

"What you going to do?" Bob asked.

"Injun scout 'round leetle 'fore we geet eats.  Mebby they hide
somewhere, take shot, oui."

"You'll be careful?"

"Oui.  Injun look out ver' queek."

While talking the Indian had jumped out of the hole and was fastening
on his snow-shoes.

"You no geet out till Injun come back," he ordered.

"You're the boss," Jack told him and the next moment he was gone.

"Hope he isn't gone long," Bob said as he sat down again.

"He seems to think of everything," Jack said.  "You and I would have
gone right out and started breakfast and made a fine target of
ourselves without giving it a thought."

"Perhaps."

"Probably."

"Perhaps."

"Perhaps what?" Jack snapped.

"Perhaps, probably," Bob laughed and Jack joined in.

A half hour passed and they were beginning to get uneasy when the
Indian returned.

"All gone," he announced.

"Good.  Now we can get something to eat and, believe me, I'm about
starved."

"Same here," Jack added.

"Now we got be mighty careful," Lucky cautioned as they were about to
start off up the river an hour later.

"You think they may be coming back?" Bob asked.

"No can tell.  We--what you call heem?--play heem safe."

"You bet," Jack declared.  "That's my motto, 'play safe'."

"Since when?" Bob asked.

"Since--since--well, since I got a good look at that half-breed,"
Jack stammered.

"I thought it was of recent origin."

They had intended to travel on the river as it was much easier than
through the woods, but Lucky told them it would be safer to keep to
the woods declaring that they would make altogether too good a mark
out in the open.

"Injun goin' keep leetle way ahead an' white boys follow heem track.
No can geet lost."

"No, but you can get shot," Bob said soberly.

"Injun no geet shot.  Injun got eyes."

"I'll say you have," Jack testified.

When all was ready the Indian ordered them to give him a start of
five minutes and then to come on with the team.  Both boys had,
during the trip, taken turns at driving the dogs and, although they
still lacked much of Lucky's skill, they could manage very well.  The
Indian took a course nearer the river than that taken by their
visitors of the night so they had no trouble in following his tracks.

"Hope he don't get too far away," Bob said as he gave the order to
mush.

They had been on the way a little over an hour when, suddenly, the
sound of a rifle shot broke the silence of the forest.

"What's that?" Bob cried as he ordered the dogs to halt.

"There's no doubt about what it was," Jack answered.  "The big
question is why?"

"Was it Lucky's rifle, do you think?"

"Don't know."

They listened for a moment or two but there was no other shot.

"Maybe he shot at a deer or something," Jack suggested.

"If he did he'll be coming back in a minute because he'll know we
won't know what to make of it."

"Well, if he doesn't show up pretty soon I'm going on.  Perhaps he's
in trouble."

"We'll wait five minutes," Bob said glancing at his watch.

The five minutes were just up when they caught sight of the Indian
coming toward them at a rapid lope.

"What's up?" Bob asked.

"Did you shoot?" Jack asked.

"No shoot, geet shoot at," he told them.

"One of those fellows?" Bob asked.

"Injun 'spect so, no see um."

"Tell us about it," Jack said as Lucky paused.

"Not mooch tell.  Injun go 'long like when bang go gun, but no geet
heet, so come back."

"Well, what'll we do?" Bob asked.

"Do you think he meant to hit you?" Jack asked before the Indian
could reply to Bob's question.

"Tink heem mean scare Injun.  No hear bullet."

"Then I move we go on.  I don't belive they intend to kill us and
anyhow they can do it about as well in one place as another up here
if that's what they are after."

"What do you think, Lucky?" Bob asked.

"We run dey catch us, we stay here dey find us yer' queek.  Mebby we
go on."

But as it happened it was not left for them to decide for just then
another shot rang out followed by the thud of a bullet as it buried
itself in the trunk of a tree over Jack's head.

"Hey, what's the big idea?" he shouted.

In answer to the question a man, whom they all recognized as their
visitor of the night before, stepped out from behind a tree about
thirty feet away.  Instantly Bob had him covered with his rifle.

"No shoot," the man cried.

"Why not?" Bob demanded.  "You've had two shots at us."

"No shoot to hit."

"Well, that last one was a bit too close for comfort," Bob told him
still keeping his rifle leveled.

"My mans all 'round you.  You shoot we keel all."

"That's different."  Bob lowered his gun as he had little doubt, but
that the man was speaking the truth.  "What do you want with us?" he
demanded.

Instead of replying to the question the breed stepped forward after
giving a shrill whistle.  Then they saw that he had indeed spoken the
truth for instantly, from all sides, five other men stepped from
behind the trees and came toward them.

"Some reception," Jack whispered.

"You come wid us," the big man ordered as he motioned to his men to
start north.

"What's the idea?" Jack asked.

"Huh?" The man snapped.

"I mean what are you going to do with us?"

"You find dat out later."

"But I want to know now."

Jack was never one to be bossed unless the one who did it had a good
right and he was mad clear through.

"No geet heem mad now," Lucky whispered and taking the hint, Jack
added:

"All right, have it your own way.  I reckon you're the doctor."

"Huh?"

"I said you're the big boss."

"Oui, me boss."  It was clear that the man was pleased with the
acknowledgment.  "You do what me say no geet hurt.  Try funny
beesness an' you better not."

"I reckon you're right," Jack assured him.

He ordered them to follow after his men and he brought up the rear
keeping a few yards behind them.

"What do you make of it, Bob?" Jack whispered after they had gone a
short distance.

"Haven't an idea, but we'll probably find out sooner or later."

"I reckon."

They noted that they were traveling in a direction which made an
angle of some forty-five degrees with the river and the way was up a
gentle rise for more than an hour.

Suddenly, when they were nearly to the top of the hill, a large but
low log cabin loomed up ahead.

"Guess we're there," Bob said in a low tone.

"You mean here, don't you?"

"It's all the same."

The five men, all breeds, were standing about the door, as they came
up, as if awaiting further orders from their leader.  He spoke some
words to them, in a French dialect, which the boys, although they
were fairly conversant with the language, failed to understand, but
it was evidently an order for one of them to show the Indian where he
was to stable the dogs.  The man motioned for Lucky to follow him
around back of the cabin and, without a word, he drove the team after
him.  The leader pushed open the door and, after slipping off his
snow-shoes, told the boys to enter.

The cabin was roughly but almost luxuriantly furnished and consisted
of at least two rooms.  The front room, in which they found
themselves, contained a large massive table in the center and a half
dozen roughly built, but comfortable easy chairs, four of them being
rockers.  A huge fireplace occupied nearly the whole of one end while
the side away from the door was lined with bunks.  Several bear and
deer skins were on the floor and above the fireplace an enormous
moose head was fastened to the logs, the antlers touching the top of
the room.  Many skins of different animals adorned the walls.
Altogether it was a most homelike appearing room and, for a moment,
the boys gazed about spellbound.

"Nice place you have here," Jack finally declared.

"Oui, eet ver' bon," their host replied evidently pleased with the
praise.

"Did you build it?" Bob asked.

"Non, me no build heem."

"Bought it, eh?"

"Non, no buy heem."

Evidently the man did not intend to enlighten them as to the means by
which he had secured possession of the cabin and Bob quickly decided
that it would not be wise to press the matter.  Instead he asked:

"Are we to consider ourselves prisoners?"

For a moment the man did not answer then, then with a slight shrug of
his massive shoulders, he said:

"Mebby."

"What do you mean by that?" Bob demanded.

"You geeve word you no try geet away you no prisoner."

"And if we refuse?"

Again the man shrugged his shoulders.  "Den you prisoner, oui."

"Then I reckon we'll have to be prisoners.  But what's the idea?"

"Huh?"

"I mean why have you taken us prisoners?"

"You find dat out plenty time."

Before Bob could speak again the door opened and Lucky, followed by
the five breeds, entered the room.  The Indian seemed as much
astonished as had the boys at the room, but they could see that he
was trying not to make any show of his astonishment.

"Deese boy no promise not to geet away," the leader said turning to
Lucky.  "You mak' 'em promise, oui?"

"Non."  The Indian shook his head.

"Den we feex you so you no geet away."

"Mebby."

"For sure, no mebby."

Lucky shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that the incident was
closed so far as he was concerned, and the leader turned to one of
the men and gave an order.

"You mak' home," he said not unpleasantly turning again to Lucky and
the boys who were standing close together.  "Dinner be ready een jest
leetle while."

Evidently the big living-room served also for the dining-room for the
cover, a huge bear skin was removed by one of the breeds and dishes
substituted.

"Reckon they don't intend to starve us," Jack whispered a little
later as one of the breeds brought in a huge roast of venison and
placed it on the table.

"Perhaps they're going to eat and let us look on," Bob suggested.

But in this he was mistaken for, after the table had been loaded with
food of many varieties, they were invited to sit up and eat.

"They've got a good chef that's sure," Jack whispered soon after they
started eating.

"Both as to quality and quantity," Bob agreed.

Great as was the quantity of food provided it disappeared rapidly
before the attack of the half-breeds who ate voraciously and with
little regard for table etiquette.  There was no conversation except
a whispered word now and then between the two boys who sat side by
side.  The Indian, whether by accident or design they could not tell,
had been placed on the other side of the table.  Two large logs were
blazing in the fireplace and, as Bob looked about the room, he was
reminded of the many tales he had read of the old Norsemen and their
crude, but rugged civilization.  It seemed that history had been
turned back a thousand years.

As soon as all had finished eating two of the men began to clear the
table while the others, with the exception of the leader, began a
game of cards at a smaller table in one of the corners near the fire.

"What you do up here, eh?"

The leader shot the question at them so suddenly that both boys gave
a sudden start.  Bob cast a questioning glance at Lucky and tried to
read in his face whether or not he ought to divulge the object of
their trip.  But the Indian's face gave no sign and, after a moment's
hesitation, he decided that it could do no harm to tell him.

"We are looking for our uncle," he said.

"Oui?  What heem name?"

"Lakewood.  Silas Lakewood."

"What heem do up here, eh?"

"He came up here from Nome some months ago on a prospecting trip."

"He no geet back?"

"No."

"What heem look like?"

"It will probably seem strange to you, but the fact is we have never
seen him," Bob replied and went on to tell how it had all come about.

"Dat bon story," the man said when he had finished.  "You say dat
man's name what come wid heem ees Long, eh?"

"That's it.  Have you seen them?"

The man slowly shook his head.  "Non, me no see them."

A little later he joined the others at cards and the three friends
were left alone at the farther side of the room where they could
converse in low tones without danger of being overheard.

"It's a queer thing that they haven't taken our revolvers away from
us," Bob declared.

"I was just thinking that same thing," Jack added.  "What's the
matter with holding them up right now?"

But the Indian shook his head as he whispered.  "Eet no go.  Dey
watch us all the tam.  You reach for gun an' they geet you first."

"He's right, Jack," Bob agreed.  "I have an idea they wouldn't object
to an excuse for shooting us.  We'd better sit tight for the present
and play it safe."

"But I'll bet my last year's straw hat that that guy was lying when
he said he hadn't seen Uncle or Long.  Didn't you notice how he
hesitated when you asked him?"

"I did, and I think you're right about the lying.  He's seen them all
right."

About an hour later the other two men came in from the back room and
joined in the game which lasted until nearly six o'clock.  Then
another two set about getting supper while the others continued to
play.  Not a word had been said to the three prisoners during the
afternoon after their first conversation with the leader and, to a
casual observer, it would have appeared that they were taking no
notice of them.  But they knew that not a single motion escaped
observation and they were very careful to make no move which could
possibly be interpreted as hostile.

The supper, although not as elaborate as the dinner, was a good one
and, although they had eaten a big dinner, they did it full justice.
The meal over the game of cards was resumed and again the three were
left to their own resources.

"My, but this is getting monotonous," Jack declared when a clock on
the mantle over the fireplace struck nine.  "If we only had something
to read it wouldn't be so bad."

But there was neither paper nor book anywhere in the room so far as
they could see.  But soon after the game broke up and it was evident
that bed time had arrived.

"You geeve promise we no tie you up," the leader said, crossing the
room to their side.

"Nothing doing," Bob fold him without hesitation.

"Den we have tie you up."

"I reckon you'll have to do as you think best about that."

"Geeve me you guns."

It was an order they had been expecting and, knowing it would be
useless to refuse, they complied, after which the man searched each
one carefully.  Then he spoke a few words to one of his men who at
once left the room returning a few minutes later with some pieces of
rope about the size of clothesline.

"You geet een deese bunk," the man ordered pointing at the end of the
room away from the fireplace.

With no protest they complied and the man proceeded to tie their
hands behind their backs and their feet together.  Then he covered
them each with a heavy blanket and said:

"You no be ver' bon sleep, but you no geeve promise."

"That's all right," Bob told him cheerfully.

"You geet cold you call an' me geet you more blanket, oui."

"Thanks."

In another five minutes the lights had been extinguished and only a
feeble flicker from the dying fire illuminated the room.  Bob had
chosen the lowest of the three bunks and he knew that Jack was in the
one next above while the Indian occupied the top one.  He had
expected they would be tied during the night, but was not sure
whether or not a watch would be kept on them.  He had, for several
years together with Jack, practiced the art of freeing himself from
bonds and both boys were about as expert at the trick as the Great
Houdini himself.  During the evening he had cautioned Jack to be on
the watch for the move so, while the man was tying their wrists
together both boys were straining every muscle in order to get as
much slack as possible when they relaxed.  But Bob had sensed during
the tying that the man was no weakling at the job and he was not at
all sure that he could free his hands when the time came.

For an hour he made no effort to get his hands free and he had
cautioned Jack to wait until he should give him the signal.  When the
clock struck eleven he gave a slight cough which a moment later was
answered from the bunk above and he knew that Jack understood.  He
was certain that they had stationed no watch, relying on the security
of the ropes, and he was also quite sure that they were all asleep
and he knew that, as a rule, these breeds were sound sleepers.

From the feel of the rope about his wrists he knew he was in for a
long job even if he succeeded.  Although he had done his best there
was mighty little slack so tightly had the man tied the rope.  He
hoped that Jack had been able to secure more, but did not dare
whisper to find out.  The half hour struck and he was still striving
and about ready to give up the task as impossible when he felt rather
than heard Jack slip from his bunk.

"You untied?"

"No, he got 'em too tight."

"I just made it and that's all."

With Jack's assistance his hands were soon free and he quickly
released his feet.

"Be careful when you wake Lucky," Jack whispered.

But, although the Indian had made no movement he was wide awake and,
as soon as Bob had freed his hands and feet, he slipped to the floor
beside them.  The room was in darkness as the fire had gone out all
but a few live coals which gave no light.

"Stay right here till I get the rifles," Bob ordered.

He knew that their rifles had been stood in a corner to the right of
the fire and he stepped across the room in that direction his
moccasins making not the slightest sound.  In a moment he was back
with the guns and they lost no time in opening the door and stepping
outside.

"So far so good," Jack whispered with a sigh of relief.

"Have they got any dogs?" Bob asked Lucky.

"I tink not.  Injun see no dog."

"Then we probably can get ours without making any noise."

"Oui, I tink so."

"It would be a big item in our favor if we could take all their
rifles and revolvers away from them," Jack suggested as they moved
away from the door.

"Too risky," Bob whispered.

"What do you think, Lucky?" Jack asked.

"Bob right.  Eet too risky."

"You may be right but it seems to me that it would be worth the risk
for we'd then have them at our mercy."

"But they'll sleep till six o'clock and that'll give us about six
hours' start."

"Start for where?"

"Gee, that's so.  Where are we going to start for?  We haven't found
Uncle yet."

"And he's up here somewhere and something tells me that that man Long
has some kind of a connection with this gang."  Jack declared as they
reached the rear of the cabin.

"And, of course, we can't go till we find him."

"Of course not."

That they were in a predicament was evident to all.  To be sure they
had made good their escape for the time being, but they well knew
that, as things stood then, their recapture was only a matter of a
few hours and their captors would undoubtedly see to it that they did
not make their escape a second time.  If only their mission was
completed and they could leave at once, the chances were greatly in
favor of a complete get away, but, come what might, all three were
agreed that such action was out of the question.  While the men had,
in a way, treated them kindly they knew that they were men who would
hesitate at nothing to accomplish their purpose whatever that might
be.

"Well, we've got to do some tall thinking and do it quick," Bob
declared.  "What's your opinion, Lucky?"

"We must no geet caught again."

"That's easy to say," Jack said.  "But how are we going to help it?
We can't move a foot in this snow without leaving tracks and they're
six to our three and in a rough and tumble we wouldn't be in it for a
minute."

"Oui, you heet eet."

"Then what can we do?  It seems to me that my plan of getting all
their weapons is the only thing left for us."

"Eet ver' risky."

"Of course it's risky, but we've taken risks before."

"Their rifles are hanging on the walls and I reckon we could get them
easy enough," Bob said thoughtfully, "but when it comes to their six
guns it's a cat of another color.  They've got them in their belts
and it would take a miracle to get them all without waking any of
them.  If it was only one or even two it might be done, but six--it's
practically impossible."

"But not absolutely," Jack insisted.

"Well, what's your plan?"

"My idea is for all of us to go in and for one of us to frisk them
while the others stand guard with the rifles ready.  If one of them
wakes up we could simply tell them that the first one to move out of
his bunk would get a hunk of lead in his skin."

"But it's dark in there and we couldn't see them and they could shoot
from their bunks," Bob objected.

"And that's where the risk comes in.  Mind I didn't say it wasn't
dangerous."

"Let's see," Bob mused aloud.  "They've probably all got at least one
gun and with our three it makes nine and even then we couldn't be
sure we had them all.  What do you say, Lucky?"

"White boys stay out here an' Injun go in geet guns."

"Not so you'd notice it," Jack broke in and Bob agreed with him.

"But that the ver' best--" the Indian began, but Bob interrupted.

"No use to argue on that line, old man.  Either we all go in as Jack
proposed, or we try some other plan."

"And that's final," Jack added.

"If it was only light enough in there so that we could keep them
covered--" Bob began.

"But it isn't, so there's no use wishing it was," Jack interrupted.
"I tell you it's our only chance."

"And it's a mighty slim one."

"I grant you that but I still stick to it that it's the thing to do.
The way I look at it is this, if one of them wakes up and starts
shooting the chances are that he wouldn't hit us and, if it got too
hot, we could bolt the door and once outside we'd be no worse off
than we're going to be when they catch us in the morning as they're
going to do if we don't get those guns."

"I don't know, but you're right," Bob said slowly.

"Of course I am."

"Do you think so, Lucky?" Bob asked.

"Oui, I t'ink heem heet eet."



LUCKY ACQUIRES AN ARSENAL.

Bob was far from convinced that the move, proposed by Jack, was a
wise one but, for the life of him, he was unable to suggest anything
else and, after a few more objections, he gave in.

"Who's going to do the frisking?" he asked.

"Injun do eet Injun ver' bon like that," Lucky told them.

"All right then.  We'll stand guard and, mind now both of you, if
they start any shooting make for the door as quickly as possible."

It was a desperate chance they were taking and Bob's heart beat
rapidly as they retraced their steps and once more stood before the
door.

"It's up to you, Lucky," he whispered as the Indian reached out his
hand to push the door open.

"Injun do heem best," Lucky whispered back.

"I know it," Bob assured him.

Another instant and they once more stood in the room.  They could
hear the heavy breathing of the men and one of them was snoring
loudly enough, Jack afterward declared, to wake the dead.  The two
boys at once took their position by the big table and the Indian
approached the nearest of the bunks.  It was so dark that they were
unable to see a hand before their eyes, a fact that Bob was undecided
whether to regard as an advantage or otherwise.  Plenty of light
would undoubtedly be to their advantage should any of the men awake
for it would enable them to keep them quiet in their bunks, but a
little light, perhaps, would throw the advantage to the other side.
Maybe, on the whole, it was just as well that it was dark.  Not a
sound save the breathing of the men and the stentorion tones of the
snorer broke the silence.  Lucky was doing his work with absolute
silence and, as minute after minute passed, Bob began to breath more
easily.  Perhaps they would succeed after all.

It seemed to him that a long time had passed when he felt a touch on
his arm and he knew that Lucky was thrusting revolvers into the
pockets of his coat.  He longed to ask him if he was through, but did
not dare and then he knew he was not for he did not give the signal
to leave.  Carefully feeling with his hands he counted six revolvers
and wondered if he had put any in Jack's pockets.  Then, suddenly,
his heart skipped a beat as he heard a movement in the direction of
the bunks.

"What de matter?" he heard one of the men grumble.

He reached out a hand and touched Jack's arm as a caution for him to
keep silent.

"Can't you no let feller sleep?" came, in sleepy tones from another
bunk.

"What for you touch me den?"

"Me no touch you, you have de dream, oui."

"Shut up you feller," came in louder tones which Bob recognized as
the leader's.

Then all was still again.

"That was a narrow one," Bob thought.

The minutes passed and he wondered if the Indian was again at his
work.  He knew he would wait some time to permit them to get to sleep
again.  Then, suddenly, he was conscious of a new sound which seemed
to come from the room at the rear.  It was so slight a sound that he
strained his ears uncertain whether or not he had really heard
anything.  It sounded like a very feeble groan and was repeated
several times so that finally he was convinced that it was no trick
of imagination.

"There's someone in that room," he thought, and wondered if Jack had
heard it.

Would Lucky never finish?  It seemed to the anxious boy that hours
had passed since they had re-entered the room when he at last felt a
tug at his sleeve and knew that the Indian was telling him that it
was over.

"Thank God," he breathed as he reached out his hand and caught hold
of Jack's arm.

A moment more and they were again outside.

"Did you get them all?" Bob whispered as soon as they were well away
from the door.

"No can tell.  Geet all could find."

"How many?"

"I t'ink ten."

"That's one apiece and one over," Jack said.  "Now what do you think
of my plan?"

"It turned out well, but if it hadn't--"

"Quit hanging crepe," Jack interrupted.  "They didn't."

"But they came mighty near it."

"I'll say they did and I was just on the point of ordering hands up
when you touched me."

"It's a good think I touched you then."

"I'll say it was."

"Say, Jack, did you hear anything while in there?" Bob asked suddenly.

"Heard one fellow snoring if that's what you mean."

"No.  I thought I heard something that seemed to come from that back
room."

"As if someone was groaning?"

"Yep, that was it."

"Now you speak of it seems as though I did.  Yes, I remember
wondering what it could be."

"Did you hear it, Lucky?"

"No, Injun too busy."

"Well, I'm convinced that there's someone there and I think we ought
to investigate," Bob declared.

"Maybe they've got Uncle Silas and that Long tied up in there," Jack
suggested.

"Just what I was thinking."

"Well there's a way to find out."

"I know, but I wish I was sure that Lucky got all their guns."

"You can't be, so what's the use of wishing?  Let's go out back and
see if there's a rear door."

"You didn't get hold of a flashlight did you, Lucky?" Bob asked as
they started around back.

"Oui, I geet one," and the Indian pulled it from his pocket and
handed it to Bob.

"Good."

They found a door at the rear as they had expected and, as they
reached it, Bob said:

"No need of more than one going in.  You two stay here and I'll see
what there is there."

"You leave door open," Lucky declared.

The door was not locked and yielded readily to his touch and he
quickly stepped inside leaving it wide open as the Indian had
ordered.  It was pitch dark inside and, for an instant, he listened.
Soon he was conscious of heavy breathing and, pressing the spring of
the flashlight, he threw its beams about the room.  As he had
expected it was the kitchen and in one corner, near the stove, lay
the body of a man.  As Bob bent over the form he perceived that it
was a man slightly past middle age.  He bent over and touched the man
lightly on the shoulder.

"S-s-s-s-h," he whispered as he moved.  "Don't make a noise."

"Who--who are you?" the man whispered.

"I'm a friend.  Are you tied?"

"Yes."

Bob knelt on the floor and in a moment had untied the piece of rope
with which the man's hands were tied behind his back.  Then he
released his feet which were also tightly bound together.

"Can you get up?" he asked.

"I--I guess so."

"Just a minute and I'll help you."

He turned off the light and thrust it into his pocket and then,
putting his hands beneath the man's shoulders he helped him to his
feet.

"You are pretty weak," he whispered.

"I'm starved.  Had nothing to eat for five days."

"The brutes."

By this time they had reached the door and in another minute were
outside.

"You found him," Jack whispered.

"Yes, and they've nearly starved him."

"Who--who are you?" the man again asked weakly.

"My name is Bob Lakewood and this is my brother, Jack and--"

"Lakewood, did you say?" the man interrupted.

"Yes, and unless I'm mistaken you are Silas Lakewood."

"And--and you--you are my nephews."

"Right, but we must not stand here talking now."

"They'll kill you if--if--" the man faltered.

"Not that bad," Bob assured him.  "You see we've got all their guns,
that is, we think we have and--"  Then he stopped short.  "Well of
all the dumb--"

"What's the matter now?" Jack interrupted.

"The rifles.  We forgot them."

"What do you know about that?"

"Injun no forgeet heem."

"You mean you got them, Lucky?" Bob asked quickly.

"Oui.  Them rifle all out whar dog be."

"But when did you do it?"

"After put leetle guns in your pocket.  Then geet rifles."

"And I thought you had gone back for the rest of the revolvers," Bob
told him.

While talking they had been walking toward the shed which stood about
forty feet to one side of the cabin, Bob and Jack supporting their
uncle one on each side.

"We'd better start now as soon as we can, eh Lucky?" Bob asked as
they stopped in front of the shed.

The Indian had gone ahead to make sure that the dogs made no noise
and assured them that he would have the team hitched in "a leetle
minute."

Among their stores were several bottles of malted milk and Bob
quickly rummaged in the pack and found one which he emptied into a
dipper and brought to his uncle.

"I reckon this is the best we can do just now," he told him, "and I'm
not sure, but that it's about the best thing you could have if you
haven't eaten for five days."

Mr. Lakewood drank the milk eagerly and declared that nothing could
have been better suited to his needs.  He had hardly finished when
Lucky announced that the team was ready to start.  Their snow-shoes
were quickly secured, having been stuck in the snow by the door of
the cabin and, as soon as they had arranged a place on the sled for
their uncle and had wrapped him in heavy blankets, they were ready
for the start.

"Where did you put their rifles?" Bob asked the Indian as the latter
picked up his long whip.

"Put 'em een binder pack on sled."

"Then I reckon we're all ready to start, eh?"

"Oui, we go queek."

But at that instant, just as Lucky was about to give the word to the
dogs, Jack grabbed Bob by the arm and whispered:

"Look."

At the same time he pointed toward the cabin and Bob's heart skipped
a beat as he saw that there was a light in the big room.

"Now the fat's in the fire," he gasped.

"But it isn't burnt, not yet," Jack told him.  "If Lucky got all
their guns they can't do much."

"If he only did," Bob repeated.

"What'll we do?" Jack asked turning to the Indian who stood staring
at the cabin, his hands on the handles of the sled.

"We go," he said stoically.  "Mush," he gave the order in a voice
little above a whisper, but the dogs heard it and bounded forward in
the traces.

"Have gun all ready," Lucky ordered.

In order to keep in the trail they were obliged to pass within a few
feet of the front door of the cabin and, as the two boys, who were
walking ahead of the sled, came opposite it, it flew open and the big
leader of the gang rushed out.  But he was not off the step before
both Bob and Jack had him covered.

"Hands up."

The order evidently was no new one to the man for he obeyed without
an instant's hesitation.

"You--you--" he started, then stopped as though at a loss for words
as he caught sight of the sled and the man seated on it as it passed
them.

"Well, what about us?" Bob demanded.

"You--you geet away?"

"Looks like it."

"But--but me--me tie you ver' hard," the man stammered.

"You sure did but not hard enough."

"How you geet untie?"

"That's telling.  Hands up there," he ordered sharply as another of
the breeds appeared in the doorway.

Instead of obeying the man dodged back into the room and Bob's heart
almost stopped.  What if the fellow had a gun?  He could easily shoot
them both from a window.

"You geet all our gun."

Bob was not sure whether the sentence was a question or a statement
of fact.

"I hope so," he said.

He was beginning to take courage again for no shot had come from the
room and he now was almost convinced that Lucky had indeed secured
them all.  Already the sled was some distance down the trail, and,
turning to Jack, he said:

"Let's go."  Then, turning back to the man who still stood "reaching
for the stars," he remarked:

"Yes, we've got your guns and I'd advise you not to follow us for,
believe me, we shall be on the watch and, after seeing how you have
treated that man you had in the back room, we'll not have the
slightest scruples against protecting ourselves."

"But you go leave us wid no gun we starve."

"That's your lookout, but I reckon it won't be as bad as that."

"You geeve me only one gun?"

"Do you think I'm a fool?"

"Me promise me no shoot."

"Nothing doing."

Seeing that his appeal was having no effect the man changed his
attitude and became threatening.

"You no geeve us guns we keel you," he stormed.

"I have no doubt but that you will if you can, but let me tell you
once for all that if you follow us we'll shoot the first man we see
and don't you forget it.  Come on, Jack."

Jack started off down the trail and Bob followed, keeping his head
turned and his gun trained on the man until they were some hundred
feet away.  Then he quickened his pace and quickly caught up with
Jack who was some distance ahead.

"Talk about your minutes of suspense," he said.  "When that guy
dodged back I expected to feel that sting of a bullet any second."

"So did I, but I reckon Lucky must have made a clean sweep of them,"
Jack declared.

"Well it sure saved our lives."

"You said it.  But do you think they'll follow us?"

"There's no telling.  I reckon they're a bit of a coward when the
cards are stacked against them."

"And Lucky sure stacked 'em that time," Jack chuckled.

"Unless they find a gun which he overlooked I don't see, but we're
safe enough.  All we've got to do is to be on our guard every minute
of the time."

"You bet."

While talking they had been hurrying along as rapidly as possible and
in a few minutes they had caught up with Lucky.

"They no follow?" he asked.

"I hardly think so," Bob told him.  "I tried to make in plain to him
that it would be dangerous to do so."

"Injun mebby ought not come on leave white boy thar but--"

"You did exactly the right thing," Bob assured him.

"Injun ver' sure he geet all um gun."

"And I reckon you did."

"Oui."

"Do you reckon they'll follow us?" Jack asked.

"No can tell."

"They'll follow us."  Mr. Lakewood made the last statement in a tone
that left no doubt as to his feelings in the matter.

"Why do you think so?" Bob asked

"Because they're scared to death of that man, Long."

"Where is he?" Bob asked eagerly.

"He left two days ago for town with a load of furs."

"On a dog sled?"

"Yes."

"It's rather strange that we didn't meet him."

"But you came up by the river didn't you?"

"Yes."

"Then that's why you didn't meet him.  You see there's another trail
back from the river and, as it's a bit shorter, he probably took it."

"Then he can't get back for at least three days more can he?" Bob
asked.

"It'll probably be four at the least, as he'll stay in town for a day
to rest the dogs and to fill up on booze."

"Then I reckon we don't need fear anything from him."

"No, I don't think so."

They had not stopped while talking, but had kept on at a slow pace
but now Lucky snapped his long lash and the dogs sprang forward at a
smart trot.

"We geet on ver' queek now," he said.

While there was no moon the sky was studded thickly with stars and,
in the north great streamers of light flashed from horizon to zenith
giving them plenty of light to travel by.  Hour followed hour and the
boys were beginning to wonder if Lucky was never going to stop for a
rest and for breakfast when he finally ordered the dogs to halt in
the middle of a large open space the first they had encountered for
some time.

"We eat," he announced.

"You bet we'll eat," Jack assured him.

"Have go some ways geet wood but no dare stop whar woods thick.  Bad
mans may be follow."

"We'll get the wood all right," Bob said as he and Jack started for
the edge of the clearing after Lucky had pulled an axe from the pack
and handed it to them.

They were fortunate in finding a dead tree almost at once and inside
of half an hour from the time they had reached the place a fire was
sending its dancing flames into the darkness.  They still had left
three of the fish Jack had caught and soon they were sizzling in the
frying pan while beside it a pot of potatoes was boiling.

"Reckon we'll have to omit the dessert," Jack chuckled as he turned
the fish.

"Who wants dessert for breakfast?" Bob laughed.

"Is this breakfast?  It's dark so much of the time up here that it's
hard to tell which is which."

Lucky, as soon as he had fed the dogs, had found another bottle of
malted milk and their uncle sat by the fire, slowly sipping the
beverage.

"Best thing I ever tasted," he told them.

"If that's good just wait till you get some of this fish," Jack
laughed.

"I suppose you are wondering how I came to be in that fix," Mr.
Lakewood said as, a little later, they started to eat.

"We sure are," Bob assured him.  "But you'd better wait till you get
a bit of your strength back before you tell us about it."

"This food is putting strength into me at the rate of a mile a
minute," he laughed, "and I'm plenty strong enough to talk.  Besides
I'll cut it short."

"And we'll be glad to hear about it," Bob assured him.

"Well, you probably know all about why I started up this way so I
won't go into that.  Oh yes, I was warned as to what kind of a man
Long is, but somehow I was drawn to him and didn't believe half that
was said against him.  But now I know it was all true and more.  He's
a rascal if ever there was one.  Everything went all right for
several weeks except that we didn't find any gold.  That didn't worry
me particularly as I came up here more from a love of adventure than
for the sake of the gold.  You see, I've got more money now than I
know how to spend, not that I mean to brag about it, you understand,
but I've always loved to hunt for gold and other things.  But our
failure to find any gold seemed to be gradually changing Long's
nature.  He became morose and actually abusive at times.

"I stood it for some time and then one day told him what I thought of
his actions and that, unless he cut it out, we'd part company.  Well,
he seemed to go almost crazy and, to make a long story short, he
finally blamed me for bringing him up here and swore that I must sign
over to him my interest in a very valuable gold mine in Colorado.  Of
course I refused and he knocked me down with his fist when my back
was turned.  I struck my back somehow in falling and have been nearly
helpless ever since although it's been getting better all the time
and is nearly well now."

"But what's his connection with those breeds?" Bob asked as he
paused.  "I suppose they're trappers."

"Yes, they're trappers and mighty good ones, judging from the stack
of pelts they've taken so far this year.  But, as to Long's
connection with them, I only know that he has some sort of hold on
them and that, strange as it may seem, they're scared to death of
him.  We stayed in that cabin you probably saw about half way between
here and Arctic City for several weeks and then he brought me up
here.  I don't know why.  We had been there about two weeks and the
breeds were kind enough to me when he wasn't around, but he tried in
every way he could to force me to sign that paper.  Why he even beat
me with a whip.  Finally he declared that I'd not get another
mouthful of food till I signed it.  That was five days ago."

"And you've been tied up since then?"

"Every minute."

"The brutes."

"You mean brute.  The breeds are really not so bad.  Two or three of
them are what you'd call good fellows and I know they wanted to help
me but they didn't dare."

"Not even after he'd gone?"

"Not even after he'd gone.  I suspect that they thought he might cut
short his trip or get back sooner than they expected and catch them
if they did for me what he'd ordered them not to do.  Oh, he owns
them body and soul all right but, as I said before, I don't know how
or why."

"I reckon it's lucky we got there about the time we did," Jack
grinned.

"It saved my life for I'd have died before I'd have given in to him.
Oh, I know that sounds foolish and I reckon it is, but I'm made that
way and can't help it."

By this time they had finished eating and Lucky declared that they
had better be on their way.  The Indian had not said a word while Mr.
Lakewood had been telling his story, but the boys knew that he had
not missed a sentence and that he was deeply impressed.  Mr. Lakewood
asked if they had an extra pair of snow-shoes, declaring that he was
strong enough to walk, but neither the boys nor Lucky would listen to
it and he finally consented to ride a little longer.



HOMEWARD BOUND.

It was about an hour later when, as they were passing through a
particularly thick bit of woods, Lucky spoke softly to Bob, who was
striding close by his side.

"You drive heem leetle while?"

"Sure."

"Injun go back leetle piece.  Want see any them breed follow."

"All right, but you be careful now."

"Oui.  Injun be ver' careful."

Jack was walking some distance ahead of the team and it was a half
hour later when he glanced back and missed the Indian.

"Where's Lucky?" he asked after waiting for the team to catch up with
him.

Bob told him where the Indian had gone and for what purpose and Jack
agreed that it was a wise move but added:

"He ought to be catching up with us pretty soon don't you think?"

"I'm giving him an hour and he's only been gone about half that time."

"I imagine he can take care of himself," Mr. Lakewood added.

"He can if anyone can," Jack agreed.  "But you've got to remember
that, if they're all following us it's six to one."

"But the one is armed," Bob reminded him.

"I know but how do you know that they might not have found a gun or
two?"

"Who's hanging crepe now?" Bob asked.

"I'm not, only we don't want to take too much for granted, not this
trip we don't."

Since the Indian had turned back Bob had permitted the dogs to
gradually lessen their pace as he did not wish to get too far ahead
and, for the past few minutes they had been moving at a slow walk.

"Think we'd better wait here?" he asked.

"I would," Jack replied.  "You see, if he doesn't show up soon we'll
have to go back and see what's happened to him and the farther we go
on the farther we'll have to go back," he explained.

Bob at once ordered the dogs to halt and the willingness with which
they obeyed the word showed that they were far from rested.  There
was probably no stronger team in the state, but they had a heavy load
and for several hours Lucky had urged them on at a rapid pace so it
was not surprising that they were tired.

Another half hour passed and they were on the point of turning back
when, without warning, the Indian stood before them.

"Gee, but I'm glad you're back," Jack declared.

"We were beginning to think you had been captured," Bob added.

"Injun no geet caught."

"But did you see any of the breeds?" Bob asked.

"Non, no see um."

"Then I guess they decided to take my advice."

"Oui, I t'ink so.  Injun go back three, four mile, no see um."

"Then you think we're safe as far as they are concerned?" Mr.
Lakewood asked.

"Oui, I t'ink so."

They traveled at a slow pace until noon when they stopped to cook
dinner and to give the dogs a couple of hours rest, and at four
o'clock Lucky announced that they would make camp for the night.

"We come seexty mile an' dog heem heap tired," he said.

"And they've got nothing on me at that," Jack told him.

"Same here," Bob added.

"And I haven't walked a foot of the way," their uncle complained.

"No mind that," Lucky told him.  "You geet walk 'nough time we heet
Nome."

Seven o'clock found them ready to turn in with the exception of Bob
who was to stand the first watch.  They had decided to divide the
night into three watches of four hours each and Bob was to take the
first.  Mr. Lakewood had insisted on taking his turn but the others
had ruled him down, declaring that he needed the sleep and rest and
finally he had reluctantly given in.

"But beginning tomorrow I want it distinctly understood that I'm
going to do my share of the work," he told them.

At eleven o'clock Bob called the Indian, who was to take the second
watch and reported that nothing had happened.  His watch also passed
without incident as did Jack's and seven o'clock found them once more
on the trail all, including the dogs, well rested and in high spirits.

If was about two o'clock when Jack, who was some distance ahead and
out of sight of the others because of a clump of bushes, suddenly
appeared running back.

"What's up?" Bob asked aware that something had happened.

"There's a dog team coming this way," he told them.

"How far away?"

"Must be nearly a mile.  There's a big open space just ahead and he's
about half way cross it."

"How many men did you see?"

"Only one."

"Then it must be Long."

"That's what I think."

"What'll we do?" Bob asked turning to Lucky.

"We go 'long, meet heem in open."

"But I'd better keep out of sight," Mr. Lakewood proposed.

"Oui, that bon plan.  You geet on sled an' cover all up an' heem no
see you till we geet ready," Lucky agreed.

Mr. Lakewood had refused to ride except at short intervals where the
going had been exceptionally good, but now he quickly took off the
extra pair of snow-shoes and got on the sled, and the Indian covered
him up with a blanket so that one would never have suspected that the
sled bore human freight.

"You breathe all right?"

"Sure."

"Then we go.  Mush."

As they swept out into the open space they saw the other team coming
at a rapid pace and not more than a quarter of a mile away.

"That Long," Lucky assured them.

"Hello, Lucky, what you doing up here?" Long sang out as soon as he
was in easy speaking distance.

"We on trip," the Indian told him.

"Where you been?" was the next question, and it was plain that he was
much disturbed in his mind at meeting them.

"Up nor'."

"How far?"

"Some way."

"Did you see my gang of breeds?"

"Oui."

"Hope they treated you all right."

"Oui."

"That's good.  But, tell me, what are you up here for?"

"We come hunt for man."

"Whatman?"

"Heem name Lakewood.  Deese boy heem nephew."

"You mean Silas Lakewood?"

"Oui."

"But he started back for Nome more'n six weeks ago.  You knew he came
with me, didn't you?"

"Oui."

"We came on a prospecting trip, but we didn't find a thing and he got
cold feet.  I wanted him to keep on with me up to my trapping camp,
but he wouldn't do it and so I had to let him go.  He ought to have
got back to Nome long before you left."

The man was trying his best to put a lot of concern into his voice.

"Heem no geet thar."

"Well, I'm sorry to hear it but, after all, it's none of my business."

"I think it is."

The words came in a loud tone from the sled as Mr. Lakewood threw the
blanket off and got to his feet.

"You!"

"Yes, it is I."

"But how--how--"

"Never mind how," Mr. Lakewood interrupted.  "I'm here and do you
know what I'm going to do to you?"

"No, but seeing it's four to one, I suppose you'll take me back and
file a complaint against me."

"And that's where you're wrong.  Bob," he said turning to the boy,
"cover him with your gun.  Now, Jack, you frisk him," he ordered as
soon as Bob had obeyed.  "Now you can put up your gun," he added
after Jack had taken two revolvers from the man's belt.  "Long, you
struck me once when I wasn't looking and in falling I hurt my back, a
fact which put me in your power for a long time.  But the back's well
now and I'm going to give you the sweetest licking you ever had in
your life.  Then you can go your way and I'll go mine and the score
will be settled."

The boys started to remonstrate, but their uncle stopped them.

"No, it's no use.  I never had much use for the law when it came to a
thing of this sort and this is a pleasure I've been promising myself
for a long time."

As he spoke he had removed his heavy coat and now he ordered Long to
do the same.

"I give you my word of honor," he told him, "that this fight will be
between you and me alone and if you get the best of me you can go on
your way and I'll never take any action against you for what you've
done to me."  Then, turning to Lucky and the boys, he ordered: "Don't
one of you interfere whatever happens."

"Heem one--what you call--game sport," Lucky whispered.

"I'll say he is," Bob and Jack both agreed.

Long was several inches taller than his opponent and the boys knew
that his height would give him a big advantage especially in the deep
snow.  But they were soon to learn that their fears were entirely
without foundation.  The lanky trapper undoubtedly would have been
able to give a good account of himself pitted against almost any one,
but he was no match for Silas Lakewood.  Although nearing his
fiftieth year he had always kept himself in the prime of condition
and, as Jack after told Bob, what he did not know about boxing simply
did not exist Three minutes after the contest started Long knew he
was licked, but he had grit enough not to beg for mercy and he got
none.

As Mr. Lakewood had promised the licking was thorough and most
beautifully administered, as Jack put it, and when it was over one of
Long's eyes was closed completely and his face was battered almost to
a pulp, but he was not seriously injured.

"I didn't want to hurt him so that he couldn't travel," Mr. Lakewood
explained as he drew on his coat.

"You sure do--what you call heem--one bon job," Lucky declared.

As for Long, he stood by his sled slowly wiping the blood from his
face.  "I hope you're satisfied," he grunted.

"I am, perfectly and, so far as I am concerned, the incident is
closed."

"And you'll not take action against me?"

"I reckon I've taken action enough," he smiled.  "No, I'll never
bother you if you keep away from me."

"Can I have my guns back?"

"No.  And we're going to see if you have a rifle and if you have
we're going to take that too."

"But--"

"No buts about it.  I don't trust you not for a minute and we're not
going to take any chances.  You may as well know that we have all the
guns of your friends which probably explains why they are not
following us.  And for that matter they may be and we figure that
should you meet up with them and had a gun you'd be too dangerous.
No, we'll leave the guns at Pete's store when we get back and you can
get them any time."

Long made no further remonstrance and they searched his sled finding
a rifle which they added to the others beneath their pack.

"So long," Mr. Lakewood cried as Lucky started his team.

But Long, who had already started made no reply.

"I guess he's sore," he chuckled.

"His face must be anyhow," Bob laughed.

"Gee, but you did it easy," Jack declared as he looked at his uncle
with admiration in his eyes.

"And I'll bet my old hat you both thought I'd get licked," he laughed.

"Well, you see, he's so much taller than you," Bob said
apologetically.

"But size doesn't always count, you know."

"Don't we?" Jack laughed

"When we get back you'll have to teach me some of those blows," Bob
said.  "I thought I knew something about boxing, but after seeing you
the conceit is all knocked out of me."

"I'll teach you all I know gladly," his uncle promised and added:
"and when I get time I'll tell you how I just missed being a prize
fighter."

It was shortly after dark one afternoon about ten days later that
Lucky halted his team in front of Pete Slinger's store in Nome.  They
had made the return trip without noteworthy event.  Long's gang of
breeds as well as the man himself, evidently having decided to let
well enough alone.

As they entered the store, Pete came from the office to meet them
but, as he was at the same time, reading a book he did not see who it
was until he was close to them.

"Well, begorra, an' it's yerselves, so it is an' ut sure is a sight
fer sore eyes ter see yer.  An' yer found yer uncle, eh?" he added as
he caught sight of Mr. Lakewood who entered the store last.

"We sure did," Bob laughed as he grasped the man's hand.  "You know
him don't you?"

"Sure.  It's meself as knows him.  An' now tell us all about ut."

"But where can I leave these things?" Mr. Lakewood asked as he dumped
an armful of rifles and revolvers on the counter.

"Fer the luv of Mike, whar did yer pick up the arsenal?" Pete gasped
as he shook hands with Mr. Lakewood.

"That's a part uv the story," Mr. Lakewood smiled.  "When you get
time we'll be glad to tell you all about it."

"Whin I git time, eh.  Sure an' it's meself as would like ter ask why
I haven't got time right now," and, striding to the door, he turned
the key in the lock and led the way back to the office saying: "This
store is closed fer business till I get that story."

The story was soon told and when Bob, who, at Mr. Lakewood's request,
had acted as story teller for the party, had finished, Pete burst but
with:

"Sure an' it's meself as knew thot man Long was a bad one but I niver
thot as how he was thot bad.  I told yer not ter go up thar wid him
yer remember."

"Yes, I know you did," Mr. Lakewood assured him.

"Oh, but it's meself as would have liked ter have seen thot fight."

"You missed a good one let me tell you," Jack told him.

"And how soon can we get a boat for Seattle?" Bob asked a few minutes
later.

"Cap'n Dick got in two days ago an' I reckon he'll be goin' out aboot
day after ter-morrow an' it's barely possible he'll let yer go
along," Pete grinned.

They found Captain Blake on board his ship an hour later and the
reunion between the friends was warm indeed.  The captain confirmed
Pete's statement that he would sail the next day but one and assured
them that he would be most happy to have them as passengers.

"We ought to get to the ranch in time for Christmas," Jack declared.

"Sure you will if we have a fair trip down the coast," the captain
assured them.  "But have you wired your father?"

"What do you know about that?" Bob asked.  "Never thought of it, but
I'll go right up town and attend to it."

Two days later, after an affectionate parting with Lucky, who, in
spite of his protests was obliged to accept a handsome present in
addition to his wages, from Mr. Lakewood and the boys, they sailed
out of the harbor just as the sun was peeping over the edge of the
ocean.

"We'll have to come up here again sometime," Jack declared as he
stood leaning on the rail for a last hand wave to Pete Slinger who
was waving them good bye from the wharf.

"Maybe we will sometime," Bob said as he too waved good bye.

<context>THE OPIUM DEN.


I did not half like the look of things.

Of the two Chinamen who were placidly smoking opium in a corner of the
opium den I had no fear. Though their bodies lay immovable as logs, the
eyes of these Chinamen turned continually in their sockets, following
my movements about the room. But they were merely idly curious, not
threatening, in the intentness of their stare. They reminded me of
pigs lolling on a muck-heap in the sunshine, too lazy to move, too
lazy almost to blink, but keeping meanwhile a watchful eye upon the
movements of an intrusive terrier.

What I did not like was the curious behaviour of the half-dozen men
whom I had found knocking their heads together in a corner when I had
entered. My appearance upon the scene had caused them to start apart so
guiltily that I was convinced the conference they were holding was for
no good purpose; and when, after a few whispered words, two of them
stole softly out, and stationed themselves at the foot of the staircase
as if to cut off my retreat, while two others got between me and the
door, I could not but feel uneasy.

The two who remained--one of whom seemed to be the leader of the
gang--were now holding a conference, the subject of which was evidently
myself, and, judging by the lowering looks they cast in my direction,
they were not about to move a resolution according me a vote of welcome.

On my road from Poplar Station to Limehouse Causeway I had not passed
a single policeman, and no one, except the old negro to whom I had
offered a couple of shillings if he would take me to a place where they
"smoked the opium," had seen me enter the house. Accepting my offer, he
had turned at right angles out of Limehouse Causeway, and walked for
some distance till we came to a narrow court.

Out of this he had piloted me at right angles into another narrower
and quite unlighted court, blocked up at the end by lath palings,
and so forming a _cul-de-sac_. At the darkest and farthest corner he
had stopped in front of what appeared to be an unlighted house, and
pushing open a door which led into a dark and evil-smelling passage,
had said: "In thar, sah!" had spat upon and pocketed my florin, and
taken himself off.

I entered, and encountering no one, groped my way along the passage
until it ended at a closed door, with a staircase immediately on the
right. In my groping I chanced to put my fingers upon the handle.
Turning it, I pushed open the door, and found myself in what seemed
like a disused kitchen. There was a dresser along one side, and a
copper for boiling clothes stood in a corner. The only light came from
a small window opening upon a yard, and as the room was practically
empty and unfurnished, I tiptoed out, and, closing the door silently,
made my way up the staircase to the first landing. Here were two doors,
under each of which a chink of feeble light was to be seen. I knocked
at the nearest door, and receiving no answer, turned the handle. It
was locked, but a scuffling noise within, and the prompt extinguishing
of the light, told me that the room was not untenanted. Knocking at
the second door, a gruff voice commended me so whole-heartedly and
enthusiastically to the care and protection of one who, in polite
circles, goes generally unmentioned, that, not desiring the further
acquaintance of the party or parties on the other side of the door, I
continued my way upstairs.

On the second landing was a window, immediately below which was the
small walled-in yard that I had seen from the kitchen, and beyond this
a patch of waste land. Just then the moon, which, like a cruiser with
"lights down," had been gliding silently and unseen across the dark sea
of the sky, came out for a moment from behind the clouds to sweep her
searchlight over this enclosed patch of ground, as over alien waters;
and, in the white surprise of the searchlight, I saw that dead cats,
cabbage stalks, and offal of all sorts were rotting and festering on
the unsavoury spot, and that beyond, on the other side of a dilapidated
fence, was the river.

"From the point of view of a criminal," I said to myself, "this
staircase offers unique advantages. For the committal of a crime, here,
surely, is a vantage ground which is ideal and ready-made to hand. A
stranger, ascending the staircase, as I am, in the dark, could be
knocked on the head with impunity, and nobody be the wiser. Under cover
of night, the body could be dropped out of the window, conveyed across
that fever-breeding piece of waste land, and hoisted over yonder fence
into the river. In an hour a corpse would be borne miles away from the
scene of the crime, leaving never so much as a trace behind to tell
how, and by whose hand, it came there."

The thought was not reassuring; and when, the next instant, I arrived
at the topmost landing, and, on opening a door and entering the den,
saw two evil-looking rascals hurry out to cut off my retreat by the
staircase, while two others got between me and the door, as already
described, I began to realise that the hospitality which seemed likely
to be pressed upon me would not be of the nature of an invitation to
stay to tea.

Just at this moment I was aware of a dull noise in the distance. There
was a slight but ever-increasing vibration in the boards beneath me,
a gathering rumble and roll as of approaching thunder, and with a
hoarsely discordant shriek, an ear-splitting babel-tumult and roar,
which seemed to shake the house to its foundations, an express train
hurtled by, almost outside the very windows.

Under the present condition of electric communication, and with no
apparatus, the sending of a telephonic message for help to the police
office would have been scarcely less impossible of accomplishment than
making known my present danger to anyone on board the train; yet so
unreasoning are we in the causes which arouse or allay our nervousness,
that the consciousness of my near presence to the railway did more to
bolster up my courage than all my philosophy. "With the trains and
their living freights so near at hand, I don't feel altogether cut off
from the outside world," I said to myself; and as the two men in the
corner were still whispering together, I plucked up heart to take stock
of my surroundings.

The den was lit by a single paraffin lamp, to the unassisted industry
of which I was at first inclined to ascribe the vile atmosphere of the
place.

  "That light we see is burning in my hall.
  How far that little candle throws his beams!
  So shines a good deed in a naughty world,"

says Portia. The light which I saw burning in the den did not shed
its beams very far; but in the matter of shedding smells in a world,
nice or naughty, I judged its capacity at a low estimate as forty
horse-power! An ordinary motor-car, in its most perfumed moments,
leaves trailing clouds of glory and cherry blossom in its wake compared
to that lamp's distribution of oily odours on the atmosphere.

Add to this the insufferable and sickening stench of opium--a stench
which I can only compare to a choice blending of onions and bad
tobacco--and the reader will not wonder when I say that my stomach
signalled for full speed astern, by retching rebelliously under my
breast-bone.

Greasy as was the atmosphere, the dirty yellow distempering of the
walls was in places even greasier. The chief articles of furniture were
two raised mattresses, the bare wall behind them being literally coated
with dirt and grease, rubbed from the chaste persons and fastidious
clothes of many smokers. Above these mattresses a crudely coloured and
revolting representation of the Crucifixion was incontinently fastened,
and upon the mattresses lay the Chinamen of whom I have already spoken.

Of the two men still whispering in the corner, the leader was of
singular appearance. In figure he was dumpy and comfortably rounded,
which was, I suppose, the reason of the nickname, "The Dumpling," which
I afterwards heard applied to him. His neck was so short, and his huge
head was set so closely upon his high shoulders, and thrust forward
so prominently, as almost to suggest the hunchback. But if the figure
was grotesque, the clean-shaven face was striking and powerful. It was
absolutely grey in hue, like the face of a dead or dying man; but so
far from being spare and haggard, as one would have expected from so
unhealthy and colourless a complexion, the face, like the neck, was
full, and the features of the fleshly aquiline type. The forehead was
high and intellectual, but the eyes were his most singular feature.
Accustomed as I am, as the phrase goes, "to read character," this man
utterly baffled me, for the eyes of two totally different men looked
out from the same head. On the occasion of which I am speaking his
eyes, when they rested upon me, seemed the incarnation of all that is
cunning, cruel, treacherous. Yet in the eyes of this same man, as I
came to know him thereafter, I have seen the most singular and gentle
melancholy.

Even on this eventful evening, when I saw him at his worst, his eyes,
as he turned from me to the fellow to whom he was speaking, and for
whom he seemed to entertain something like affection, softened as if in
response to some inner workings of his mind, and I saw in their depths
a dumb, inarticulate look like that one sees sometimes in the eyes of a
dog.

As he was talking he turned suddenly--perhaps because of something
which his companion had said--and looked me straight in the eyes. I
shall no doubt be laughed at when I say that I was suddenly seized by
the most singular sense of helplessness. My powers seemed paralysed at
their centre. Minded as I was to struggle or to cry out against the
influence he was exerting upon me, I could do neither. Then--whether
the result of mesmerism or of thought suggestion on his part, or of a
sort of second sight on mine, I cannot say; but I saw, as in a tableau,
myself lying helpless upon my back, with this man kneeling on my chest,
his eyes looking into mine as they were looking now, and an upraised
knife in his hand.

What could it mean?

I am not a nervous, neurotic person, but a healthy, normal, open-air
being, who has never dabbled in the mysteries of spiritualism,
hypnotism, second-sight, or clairvoyance; nor had such tableaux as I
saw when looking into this man's eyes ever before presented themselves
to me.

For a moment he held me thus, and then there was the sound of a laugh.
Whether it was the man then standing before me in the opium den who
thus laughed, or whether it was the man I had seen kneeling on my
chest, a knife in his hand and my life at his mercy, I do not know, and
matters nothing, for the face was the same. Then suddenly he turned
from me, another being altogether.

"No, don't, old man; think of the risk you run," I heard him say to his
friend, laying a hand affectionately on the other's shoulder, those
inscrutable eyes of his--all the cunning and cruelty gone--becoming
liquid and appealing.

But to myself I said: "One day--perhaps within the next hour, perhaps
to-morrow, perhaps in the far future--this man, knife in hand, will
kneel over my prostrate and helpless figure, as I saw him kneel just
now; and when that moment comes--come it to-night, to-morrow, or come
it ten years hence--one of us two must leap the barrier which fences
this world from the next, ere he shall escape. Which of us two shall it
be? And when shall that moment come?"

As I so spoke the two men turned to me. Evidently they had arrived
at some decision, and that they meant to do me a mischief, if not to
murder me outright, I knew as surely as if someone had whispered their
plans in my ear. Once again their leader fixed me with his eyes. Once
again I was conscious of the same strange feeling of helplessness;
and once again figures shaped themselves before me as in a tableau.
Two men were lying in wait on a dark staircase to brain yet another
man--myself--as he groped his way out.



THE MAN WITH THE PICTURE-EYES.


"Good evening."

It was the leader of the gang who had spoken, smiling and rubbing his
hands softly the one on the other, as pleased, apparently, as any
purring cat.

"Good evening," I responded curtly.

"May we ask to what we owe the pleasure of your presence here?" he
continued suavely, but watching me closely meanwhile.

"My presence here?" I said, as if surprised by the question. "Why
shouldn't I come here, any more than you? It is a public place, isn't
it? And I came here to smoke opium, as you and your friends have done,
I suppose; just as one goes to a tavern for a glass of beer."

"Not at all," he replied. "This is a private house, just as much as
your own house is, and you have no more right to force your way into
it, than I have to force myself into yours. You stand in the position
of a trespasser. For all I know to the contrary, you may even be what
in America they call an area sneak-thief, except for the fact that you
have sneaked your way to the top of the house instead of to the area.
May I ask who directed you here? I _must_ ask, for I insist upon having
an answer."

"'Must' and 'insist' are not palatable words or pleasant," I said; "but
I don't know that I have any objection to tell you. It was a negro
match-seller whom I saw outside Poplar Station. I offered him two
shillings if he would take me to an opium den, and it was to this house
he led me."

"Ah! A negro match-seller, and outside Poplar Station. Oh, yes. I think
I know the fellow. We must look into this."

He stopped to cast a sidelong glance at the other man, who nodded and,
walking to the door, stood whispering to his two confederates outside.
Fearing that they were planning to attack me from behind, I twisted my
head slightly so as to keep half an eye and the whole of an ear towards
them, but not so much so as not to have the other eye open to any
movement of their leader, who was still in the room. As he was silent,
I was now able to give both ears to the whispering outside; but what
it was about I could not for all the sharpness of my hearing make out,
except for the fact that I distinctly caught the words "Black Sam."

Then, greatly to my relief, the two men, with whom the fellow at the
door was whispering, nodded and took their departure, clumping heavily
down the staircase to the second landing, to the first, and thence to
the door. Here I distinctly heard a sound as of the letting go of a
spring latch, which in all probability locked the door from the inside.
Then the door was banged to, as if to ensure that it was securely
shut; but even this did not satisfy them, for, if I were not very much
mistaken, they tried it, before leaving, by pushing heavily against it
from the outside.

To know that the front door of the house was in all probability locked,
and that, if my hosts and I came to hand-grips, my chances of escaping,
by making a bolt for the street, were now cut off, was not reassuring.
But I drew what consolation I could from the fact that the assailing
force by which I was surrounded was reduced from six to four--two in
the room and two on the staircase outside; and so I put as bold a
face as I could upon it when the man, who had been cross-examining me,
opened fire once more, his companion standing meanwhile just inside the
door.

"And now, sir," resumed the counsel for the prosecution, "that we know
to whom we are indebted for the pleasure of your company here, will you
be so very good as to tell us why you are here at all?"

Thus far I had told him the truth, and I saw no reason why I should not
continue to do so. It was Lord Beaconsfield, I think, who said that,
when he wished to mystify his opponents, he almost invariably did so by
telling them the truth. That being the last thing they expected from
him, they would jump to the conclusion that the facts were the other
way about, and so go hopelessly wrong at the start.

My reasons for deciding to be frank were based upon no such subtlety.
That I had, quite unintentionally, blundered into a den of criminals,
seemed evident; and undoubtedly the next best thing to do was to get
out. I am not, I hope, altogether a coward, but one man, caught as I
was, like a rat in a trap, is no match for four, possibly for six--for
how was I to know that the two who had been stationed outside the
door, and had apparently departed upon some errand, might not return?
I could not even be positive that they had not been told off to wait
for me in the dark court outside, so that in the event of my managing
to escape unharmed from the house, they might prevent me from reaching
the street. In coming to the place at all, I had beyond question put my
head between the jaws of a lion; and the man who, with his head between
a lion's jaws, plays the fool by trying to twist the beast's tail, must
not be surprised if, within the next two seconds, his own head be not
on speaking, or even on nodding terms, with his own body.

"I don't mind telling you why I'm here," I said civilly. "Why should
I? It is only because I have been asked to write an article on opium
dens for the _Charing Cross Magazine_. The den I visited once before in
Ratcliff Highway has been pulled down, and a big Board School built on
the site. I knew that there were dens somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Limehouse Causeway, but I didn't know exactly where to find them, so I
took the train to Poplar, gave a negro match-seller--who, I guessed,
knew something of the locality--a couple of shillings to take me to
'where they smoked the opium.' He brought me here, where I am, and
where apparently I ought not to be, judging by what you say. If I have
intruded or trespassed, I'm sorry. So, with your kind permission, sir,
I'll say 'Good evening' and take myself off."

"Stop a moment," he said, looking at me more amicably. "Your
explanation is quite straightforward and satisfactory, and now that
you've made it, I don't mind telling you the reason for what you must
have thought strange behaviour on our part.

"This place, as you see for yourself, is an opium den, and these
gentlemen," indicating the Chinamen on the mattresses, the two men at
the foot of the stairs, and his companion, "are sailors. Opium smoking
is forbidden among sailors in the employ of English vessels, and we
thought when you came in that you were an officer from one of the
vessels, who had managed to find out the den, and had come here to make
yourself unpleasant. That is why I sent those men to guard the door
and the stairs. If you had been what we thought you--well, I'm afraid
you'd have been rather roughly handled. We don't intend to allow ships'
officers, or anyone else, to come here interfering with our pleasures
or with our takings, for, of course, we don't run the den out of
charity. Now that I know it's all right, I'll just have a word with my
friends on the stairs, and tell them that they needn't stand on guard
any more. They'll be glad to get away, for they are thirsty rascals
both, and were just off for a drink when you came in."

Taking his companion by the arm, he walked out upon the landing, where
all four of them began whispering together.

Scarcely were they out of the room when, from the mattress where the
two Chinamen lay, a single word, uttered softly, warningly, stealthily,
almost in a whisper, under the breath, reached my ear.

It was my own Christian name, spoken in unmistakable English: "Max!"



THE LUCIFER THAT SAVED MY LIFE.


Surprised, not to say startled, I certainly was, and all the more so
for the reason that I recognised the voice of the speaker. It was that
of my long time friend and at one time colleague, Robert Grant, the
detective.

When I turned round--not suddenly or abruptly, for I feared to attract
the attention, possibly the suspicion, of the four men still whispering
on the landing--the two Chinamen were still sucking nonchalantly at
their flute-shaped opium pipes, and still eyeing me, as I have already
said, as pigs, lying on a muck-heap in the sunshine, eye a terrier who
has entered their domain.

Stretching my arms, I affected to yawn, as if tired of waiting the
result of the conference outside. Then, hands deep in my trousers
pockets, I slouched leisurely across the room and bent over the
Chinamen's mattress, as if to examine the picture of the Crucifixion
which was plastered on the wall above.

The nearer of the two Chinamen made a great pretence of puffing noisily
at his pipe, as if trying hard to prevent it from going out, but
between each puff came a volley of whispered words in soft staccato:

"Make pretence to be friendly with them--disarm suspicion--but get
away--if they'll let you--go to police station--say it's me--arrest the
lot. Look out--they're coming--go away!"

The "they" were the leader and the other man.

They now returned to the room, still whispering, and the two who had
been on guard at the head of the stairs, after noisily calling out
"Good-night," made their way down, and so into the street, for we could
distinctly hear them unlocking the door, which this time--as I did not
hear it banged to--they had apparently left open.

"I don't think much of your Art Exhibition," I said, turning to the
leader of the gang and jerking my thumb over my shoulder in the
direction of the hideous representation of the Crucifixion, at which I
had made pretence to be looking. "It reminds me of what I once said to
a famous art critic and æsthete about a picture that hung in some cheap
bachelor lodgings of mine.

"'I have a picture in my room,' I said to him, 'that will give your
æsthetic senses a cold chill, not to say a shock. It's "Daniel in the
Lions' Den," done in chromo--four colours--and loud enough to win a
whistling match.'

"'How terrible!' said my friend. 'But I can imagine something even more
terrible.'

"'What is it?' I inquired.

"'A poor lion in a den of Daniels,' was the reply."

I told this story, as the reader will have surmised, in pursuance of
Grant's advice to "make pretence to be friendly," and apparently it had
the desired effect, for the leader of the gang seemed amused.

"I think I can place the man who said it," he said. "I used to meet him
often in Paris. No; we're not great on Art here, and that picture over
the couch is a terror. I've made it all right for you with my friends.
Would you like to smoke a pipe of opium, now you're here? You can if
you like."

"That's very kind of you, but I don't think I'll stop to-night," I
replied. "Fact is, you gave me a fright between you, for really I
thought you meant knocking me on the head."

He laughed.

"All right; come some other night, if you like. I'm sorry if we
frightened you, but of course we have to protect ourselves, and really
I thought at first that you had come here to interfere with our
customers and with our business. But it is all right now, and if you
want to be off, we won't detain you. Good-night."

"Good-night," I answered pleasantly, glad to get away, and making for
the door. With my hand on the handle I turned and looked back. My late
host, the man whom I have called the leader, was standing--a sort of
pocket caricature of Napoleon--his hands behind his back, and his
short legs straddled widely apart. His great head, resting almost on
his shoulders, was thrust forward, vulture-wise, the eyes glittering
venomously out of the dead-white face. On the mattress behind him, the
two men whom I had supposed to be Chinamen, but one of whom I now knew
to be Detective Grant, pulled away at their pipes as nonchalantly as
ever, the ghastly figure of the Crucified One stretching bare arms
over them on the wall.

"Good-night," smiled the leader again. "Good-night, and _bon voyage_."

I do not know why I shuddered--perhaps out of fear for Grant;
perhaps at the thought of the sacred figure of the Saviour in such
surroundings; perhaps merely because I was tired and overstrained.

But with the shudder shaking me, almost like an ague, I turned, closed
the door, and made my way down the stairs.

From the second landing window, the yard which lay immediately
underneath and the stretch of waste land beyond, looked more
darkly-desolate than ever. A single light on the far side of the river
made a snake of fire, writhing and twisting as if in the throes of
torturing agony upon the water. Otherwise, nothing moved, nothing
stirred.

Arrived at the first landing I saw that the chink of light from under
the two doors had gone, so that the stairs, leading down to the passage
and to the kitchen door, were in absolute darkness. As I reached the
bottom of the stairs and turned into the passage, I was immensely
relieved to see that the front door stood ajar, evidently as the two
men who had just gone out had left it. The whiff of outer air which
blew through the opening was infinitely sweet after the reek and stench
of opium in the den upstairs. My spirits rose at a bound. Surely I must
have been mistaken in thinking the house other than merely a place for
the smoking of opium. If anything illicit, anything in the nature of
crime, were carried on here, the door would not have been left ajar,
as I now found it, nor have been left unlatched and unlocked as it was
when I had first come to the place.

All this went through my brain in a flash while my foot was between the
last step of the staircase and the passage floor. Then suddenly the
picture I had seen, when looking in the eyes of the leader of the gang,
flashed before me--the picture of a man in a dark passage, as I at that
moment was, and two other men waiting to brain him as he groped his way
out.

"It's precious dark here!" I said aloud as if to myself, and in the
most unconcerned voice I could assume. "I must go carefully, for I
nearly came a cropper over the break-neck stairs in going up."

Meanwhile, I had been feeling stealthily in my pocket for a match-box.

Ah! I had it!

Slipping out a vesta, I struck it sharply, and placing the palm of my
open hand between the flame and myself, so as to shade my own face and
to cast what light there was in the direction of the door, I scanned
the passage as if I had of a sudden become all eyes. Stretched across,
just where it would take me over the ankle and so cause me to stumble
forward, was a piece of wire. Behind the door, and with what looked
like an iron bar, upraised ready to strike as I fell, was a man; and in
case he failed to finish me, another--for I saw the white face of him
peeping through the chink of the partly opened door--stood outside. And
then, as the light in my hand suddenly flickered and went out, I heard
behind me the stealthy steps of someone creeping down the stairs.



CRIMINALS, CHEMICALS, AND A CRUCIBLE.


Smoking may, as some good folk aver, be a vile and filthy habit, but
it was the fact that I am a smoker which saved my life that night. On
my way to the den I had fancied a pipe, and finding I had no matches,
had been at the outlay of a penny in the purchase of a box. But for the
fact that I happened to have these lucifers with me, and so was able
to obtain a light, I should have blundered into the trap that was so
cunningly set for me. But for the fact that, in the moment of striking
the match, the light had fallen upon the kitchen door, and I had seen
that a key stood in the lock on the outside, I might never have needed
pipe or matches more.

To remount the stairs would have been madness, for the four men--two
above and two below--would thus have me at such disadvantage between
them, that my fight for life was likely to be short. To go forward,
weaponless as I was, with two armed and sturdy ruffians waiting for
me at the street door and possibly with two others prepared to act as
reinforcements outside--would have been equally mad, especially as the
leader and his confederate were already almost on my heels, and so
could knock me on the head from behind. But the key on the outside of
the kitchen door offered me the chance at least of a fight for my life.
Whisking it out, quicker than any conjuror, I threw open the door, and
shutting it with a bang as I entered the kitchen, set my left knee and
the whole weight of my shoulders and body against the panels, while I
slipped the key into its place, and, turning it, locked myself in, and
my opponents out.

The next moment I heard the voice of the leader on the stairs outside:

"What's that? Who's gone into the kitchen? You cursed bunglers! Don't
say you haven't killed your man. He mustn't leave the place alive. It's
Robert Grant, the detective. I'd had word that he'd tracked us, and
meant trying to get in here to-night. Parker and Smudgy, fast as you
can to the yard. If you look slippy and put your back into it, you'll
be in time to cut off his escape, should he try to get out behind. If
he does, kill him on the spot. No mistake about it this time, mind,
even if you have to shoot! Now go. Joggers, you and I'll see to things
this side. First shut and lock the front door, and pocket the key.
It'll be safer so. We've got to break in this door, and if he managed
to rush us, he might slip past, and so get out. Have you got your knife
and revolver handy? Be ready to use 'em the instant the door's down."

Clearly I had no time to spare. Striking another vesta I took one
lightning peep around. By the light I saw that what, when I had peeped
into the room before, I had taken to be an ordinary kitchen copper, was
a strange-looking vat, with something like a stove under it.

Opening a cupboard which the darkness had caused me to overlook on my
previous entrance, I saw that the top shelf was full of bottles, jars,
and tins, all containing what I took to be chemicals. On the bottom
shelf was something like a crucible, and beside it lay half a dozen
metal things shaped like neckless bottles, and reminding me a little
of artillery slugs. What did it all mean? Was I in a coiners' den--an
illicit distillery--an infernal machine factory? Ha! I must be off!
Already someone was making frantic but systematic efforts to prise open
the door.

One more hurried glance around. Who knew but that I might light upon
something in the nature of a clue to the mystery? No; that was all.
Except for the things of which I have spoken, the place was absolutely
empty.

Stop a moment. What was that lying curled up in a corner? A cat--a dog?
No; it was a fur cap.

Bang! They were trying to break open the door. The next instant I was
at the window. Screwed up, was it? No matter. Snatching up the fur cap
and twisting it around my fist that it might serve as a sort of buffer
or boxing-glove, and so protect my hand from broken glass, I knocked
out enough of the framework, and of the glass, to allow me to scramble
through, with no more serious hurt than a few scratches and some rents
in my clothing. Within the next ten seconds I was across the yard, and,
by the aid of an empty box, had scaled the wall, and was over on the
waste land. Here I stopped for an instant to take my bearings, for at
that moment the inconsiderate moon broke out from behind the clouds,
and with such brightness that I could scarcely hope to escape being
seen, and so would have been an easy target for a passable marksman.
The piece of waste land was enclosed on my right and on my left by
corrugated zinc fences. I could easily have climbed them, but the
scuffling and scraping of my feet and body against the metal would have
advertised my whereabouts to the enemy; and by this time I knew that
the two men, Smudgy and Parker, whom their leader had sent to cut off
my retreat, must be close at hand. Selecting the fence which cast the
darker shadow, I made straight for it, and then turning off at right
angles, I scuttled along half crouching, and keeping as close to cover
as a mouse keeps to the wainscot when hieing him to his hole. I was now
going--and purposely--in the direction of the river, where the fencing
was of wood, not of metal, and so might be scaled less noiselessly.
Moreover, two or three stunted trees threw ragged shadows across the
moonlight in that quarter, and so might serve to screen me from my
pursuers. Just as I reached these trees I heard voices on the other
side, so I dropped like a dead thing in the shadow at the foot of the
fence, and lay listening.

I was none too soon, for the next instant someone scrambled up on the
other side of the fence, to spy out the land. For a moment I feared
that I was discovered, though I dared not look up. I knew by the place
from which the sound came that the speaker was exactly over my head.

"Can't see anything, Smudgy," the voice said. "But I can hear the
Dumpling breaking in the door. We'll hop over and make sure that Grant
doesn't get out by the window. You go one side of that iron fence and
I'll go the other, and then, between us, we can't miss him if he comes
out; but stay in the shadow till you get to the house.

"Keep your eyes skinned, for if we were to miss our man this time, the
Dumpling would be like a madman. Steady does it. Right O! But stop a
moment. What's that in the shadow there, under the trees, just where I
jumped?"



A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS.


The fellow had walked some way in the direction of the house after
vaulting the fence, but now he turned and retraced his steps towards
the spot where I was lying, with my legs drawn up to my body. As he
stopped to bend over me, I let out with my left foot, as viciously as a
kicking horse, taking him in the stomach, and with such force that he
doubled up like a hinged draught-board, and lay quite still.

Then I leapt to my feet.

"Jones! Jim! Wilson!" I shouted, using, haphazard, the first names
which came to my tongue. "Here they are! Over the fence as fast as you
can, and we'll nab the two of 'em!"

As I spoke I kicked out a heel behind me, scraping it against the fence
as if someone were endeavouring to clamber up on the other side.

"Fast as you can!" I yelled again, making noise enough for three, and
rushing in the direction of the other man, shouting as I ran.

The dodge succeeded; for supposing, as I wished him to suppose, that he
had walked into a police ambush, he made a bolt for the house, I after
him, still yelling imaginary instructions to imaginary men.

No sooner was he gone than I whipped back to the other fellow, who I
suppose had fainted from pain, for he lay quite still where he had
fallen. But he was armed, as I knew, for I had heard the leader tell
the two of them not to hesitate to shoot. I had run risks enough, and
more than enough for my liking, on this eventful evening; so, partly
to equip myself with a weapon, in case of the other man's discovering
my ruse and returning, partly to disarm the gentleman on the ground,
in the event of his recovering consciousness sufficiently to join in
the pursuit of me, I slipped my hand into his pocket in search of
fire-arms. The first thing on which I lighted was, strangely enough, a
pair of handcuffs, and, under the impulse of the moment, I snapped them
around the unconscious man's wrists. Then, having possessed myself of
his weapon--an ugly revolver--I walked to the fence and looked over
it, in preparation to vault. The river washed almost to the fence's
foot, and, but for the fact that a boat was fastened to a stake driven
into the mud, my retreat would have been entirely cut off. Evidently
Parker and Smudgy must have taken a boat from somewhere to get round to
the back of the place. That, then, was what the leader had meant when
he spoke of the "yard," and had urged them to "put their backs into it."

Oh, well! the boat which had served their purpose would serve mine.
But stop a minute. No one was coming from the house, where I could
still hear the besiegers battering at the kitchen door. It was a
daring idea, this of mine! But why shouldn't I carry it out? To take
a prisoner, instead of myself being taken prisoner or being murdered,
would be to turn the tables on my enemies with a vengeance. The man was
unconscious; he was handcuffed; and even if he proved to be heavy, I
knew myself to be fairly strong.

Kneeling on one knee, I raised his insensible body so that his head
and chest and trunk lay inertly over my left shoulder, where I could
best bear the weight. The next thing to do was to get upon my feet.
It was not easy of accomplishment, for the man was heavily built, and
I, though tall, am somewhat slight. But I managed it at last, and
staggered to the fence, upon which I hoisted my burden, where he lay
for all the world like a straw-stuffed Guy Fawkes, his silly head and
his body and shoulders lolling helplessly towards the river, his hips
and legs hanging down limply on the side of the fence that faced the
house. Then I scrambled over myself, muttering, "You come along o' me
to Westminster, my pretty. A man who can hang both sides of a fence, as
you can, is wasted outside of Parliament."

I hauled him over, a bit at a time, until at last I was able to lower
him gently to the ground. Then I dragged him--through the water I am
sorry to say--to the boat, and with no small difficulty contrived to
tumble him in. This was the most troublesome part of the business,
for the boat behaved as coyly as a girl when a sweetheart tries to
snatch a first kiss--dodging this way and that, ducking and dipping,
till the pair of us were like to be thrown headlong into the water.
But I achieved my purpose at last, and having lashed my captive's
ankles together with the rope--the "painter" yachtsmen call it, do they
not?--by which the boat had been fastened, I took up the oars and rowed
out into mid-river.

By this time my captive was beginning to show signs of returning
consciousness, his revival being accelerated, no doubt, by the wetting
he had received in being dragged into the boat. Apparently he was still
in pain from my kick, for he groaned feebly once or twice, and then
moaned: "I feel sick."

"Yes," I said, "and you'll feel sicker before I've done with you."

It was brutal to speak thus to a man defenceless, and in pain; but I
had been under a terrible strain that evening, and now that the danger
was passed, the inevitable reaction had come, and none could have
been more surprised than I was to find the reaction take the form of
something like savagery. By nature I am by no means vindictive; but,
remembering that this very man had gone round to the back of the opium
den with the deliberate intention of murdering me, I took, I am ashamed
to say, a cruel and catlike pleasure in having him thus at my mercy,
and in seeing him a prey to the same terrors which I had been compelled
to endure. Police magistrates and His Majesty's judges may to-day
replace the rude justice of the primæval forest; but in spite of the
humanising and refining influence of civilisation, the beast in us dies
hard.

"Where am I?" he inquired, trying to raise his head.

"You're clearly a man of very little originality," I said, still
exulting savagely in having him at my mercy, instead of being--as
earlier in the evening I was like to be--at his. "'Where am I?' is what
they all say--whether on the stage, or in a novel, or in real life--on
recovering from a faint. But, if you particularly wish to know where
you are, I don't mind telling you. You are in a boat on the river
Thames, somewhere off Limehouse; but you'll be in even less comfortable
quarters before long, if I'm not much mistaken."

"Who are you?" he asked.

"Well," I said, "anyone listening to our conversation might think
that I was 'A' and you were 'Q' in Mangnall's book of Questions and
Answers. I should think you'd know who I was without having to make
so many inquiries, Mr. Parker. I'm the man you and your friend Smudgy
were told off to murder not so very many minutes ago. Now you are my
prisoner, and with your very kind permission, or without it, I'm going
to hand you over to the police."

"For God's sake don't do that!" he cried, trying to rise. This his
handcuffed wrists and bound ankles prevented him from accomplishing;
finding which, to my surprise and dismay, he fell back blubbering like
a baby.

"Give me a chance, Mr. Grant," he begged. "I've gone against the law I
know, but I've been drove to it, sir, drove to it by being out of work
so long."

"Look here," I said; "tell me what you and the man you call the
Dumpling and the other rascals are after, and if I find you've told
me the truth and kept nothing back, I'll let you go. It is your only
chance; and considering the way you'd have treated me, I think it is a
very generous offer.

"There's a mystery, and it strikes me a very wicked and criminal
mystery, about all this--that opium den with its crucible, and
chemicals, and queer instruments in the kitchen, the Dumpling, the
Chinamen, yourself, and the other men. I've got to know all about it,
and to know it now and here, this night, and in this boat. Make a clean
breast of it; tell me everything, and I'll let you go. Refuse, and I
take you straight, handcuffed and tied up as you are, to the police.
Come, no beating about the bush. Which is it to be? 'Yes' or 'No'?"

"I can't help myself," he answered. "You say you've got to know about
the Dumpling and the house, and the rest of us, and what we're after,
and that I've got to choose between telling and being handed over to
the police. You swear, you take your Davy, you'll let me go free if I
tell?"

"I swear it," I said. "Tell me all, and I swear to loose you and put
you ashore free and unfollowed--when you've done."

"Very well," he replied sullenly, doggedly. "I'll tell. But the
Dumpling"--with an oath--"will find me out and kill me if he gets to
know that I've peached."

"We'll hope he doesn't hear," I said, settling myself down to listen,
but pulling gently at the oars meantime.

Then Parker began his story.



THE MILLIONAIRES' CLUB.


"It's this way," Parker began a trifle importantly--and something there
was in his way of saying even these three words which made me suspect
him to be a man fond of the sound of his own voice. Though entirely
uneducated, he had, as I afterwards heard, a keen memory, and a ready
knack of picking up scraps of information, both of which stood him in
good stead in the speeches upon social subjects which he was apt to
deliver in the parks on Sunday afternoons, and at other places where
debaters foregather.

"It was this way, Mr. Grant. What with the strikes, and the work going
out of the country, to Germany and America, and never coming back, in
consequence of the strikes, things have been cruel hard in East London
this winter, and when a big firm of ship-builders closed their yards,
and went North, that meant starvation to thousands of us. Then the
Dumpling turned up, and used to address meetings of the unemployed.
'Law!' he says to them as was agitating to have the law altered, 'while
you are asking for law, your wives and children are starving. The law
won't do nothing for you unless you force it; and the rate you're going
on, you won't force it--not an inch in ten years; and where will you
be then? Starved, and in your graves, you and your wives and children.
You can send a score or two of your Labour leaders to Parliament, and
much good that will do you. They can't make laws; there aren't enough
of them in Parliament to do it. They get voted down, and then where are
you? Look here, boys,' he says; 'it's Parliament as makes the laws,
and Parliament, even this Parliament, a big part of it, is made up of
landowners, and landlords, and company promoters, and capitalists, and
big employers, and sweaters. They aren't going to make laws against
themselves--'tain't likely. For one poor man in Parliament there's
fifty rich, and you haven't got no chance there. But, boys,' he says,
a-wagging his finger at us, 'for every rich man in Parliament there's
hundreds and thousands out o' Parliament as is poor and starving.
You're in a minority in Parliament, and minorities always get crushed.
We have got it on the authority of a Cabinet Minister--and _he_ ought
to know. But it's _them_ as is in a minority outside. If you have men's
blood in your veins, you'll up and crush them. You're a thousand to
one, you poor, what sweat and slave and starve to make money for the
rich folk to spend. What I say to you is: Don't plead for your rights
no more. You take 'em, as you can if you like, and let the rich people
have a turn at the pleading. It's you who hold the whip--not them. If
the down-trodden people of the country was only to rise up and assert
their rights, the landlords and landowners and grabbers and sweaters
couldn't hold out for one hour. Come out of it, boys! Come out of it,
all of you who are men and not monkeys. Monkeys!' he says. 'Yes, you
are monkeys. You are like monkeys chained to a piano-organ, and the
piano-organ that's what they call Parliament. The poor man he has to
do the dancing and get the whip, same as the monkey does, and the rich
man gets the money and chooses the tune. But, boys,' he says, 'do you
think if there was a million o' monkeys for every man as kept a monkey
and an organ--do you think the monkeys would go on letting themselves
be kept like slaves upon a chain? Not they! They'd be up and fight for
their lives and liberty with nails and teeth.'"

All this time we had been drifting slowly down the river on the slack
of the tide. The night was now very dark and inclined to be foggy, so I
turned the boat's head round, and began to pull towards town.

"What was the scheme that was to be carried out to-night?" I questioned.

"What are we going back for, and where are you taking me?" asked Parker
suspiciously, counter-questioning.

"I'm going back," I replied, "because it's getting very dark and
promises to be foggy. Get on with your story, but do your best to cut
it short."

"I don't want to make it any longer than I can help," was the reply;
"but if I don't tell it my own way I can't tell it at all. Well, that's
the way the Dumpling talked to us, and there was no denying that what
he said was true. And he did more than talk at meetings. He got hold
of Smudgy and me and some more of us, and said if we'd throw in our
lot with him he'd see we were paid something each week out of a fund
that had been started in America and Germany and other places, for the
benefit of agitators and workers in the cause of liberty all over the
world. And he kept his word, too. We got it regular each week, and by
and by he put us on to little jobs--I needn't stop to tell you about
them now--that put more money in our way. We kicked at some of them at
first, but he's a nasty man to argue with, and pointed out that we were
helping the cause by taking money from the rich to use it for them as
was working in the cause of the poor, and after that we said----"

"You're rather long-winded, my friend," I interrupted; "and again I
must point out to you that it's getting cold and foggier and late.
Can't you cut the thing shorter yet, and come to the opium den and
to-night's work?"

"That's just what I was going to," replied Parker in an injured tone.
"Perhaps I am a bit long-winded. The Dumpling used to say I was, and
he's one of them clever ones what ought to know. He said once----"

"Oh, never mind what he said!" I interrupted impatiently. "Get on
quickly to the opium den and to-night's work. It's of that I wish to
hear."

"One night," continued Parker, "the Dumpling asked Smudgy and me if
we'd like to stand in with him in a little scheme he'd got to make a
pot of money. And this very night we was to meet in that opium den--us
as was in it--to arrange things. I didn't half like the job, that's
the fact, especially when I found that detectives were on the track.
But the Dumpling isn't the sort of man you find it easy to say 'No'
to, when he turns that north eye of his on you. Makes me feel quite
helpless, he does, and cold all down my back."

I nodded.

"Yes, I can believe he's not a pleasant customer to come the wrong side
of; but that's no excuse for you and Smudgy trying to murder me."

"We didn't mean murdering you or anyone else," protested Parker. "The
Dumpling he says to us, 'Boys,' he says, 'I've got everything arranged,
and we'll carry this thing through to-night. But I don't play no losing
games. Grant, the detective, is on our track, and if he comes between
us and our business--him and his blue coats--he'll have to take the
consequences. So you'd better be armed,' he says, and he gives Smudgy
and me and the other chaps a revolver each, and a knife. 'Don't shoot
unless you have to, or unless I tell you to,' he says. 'Them as plays
the game we're going to play had best keep a silent tongue in their
head, and there's no tongue so silent and so sure as a sharp knife. It
does the work and don't holloa about it. But pistols is noisy servants.
So don't use the shooting irons unless you're compelled to.'

"Smudgy and me we took the knives--I've got mine on me now--and the
pistols, but we agreed we wouldn't use 'em. Nabbing a bit o' money's
one thing, but getting nabbed for murder's quite another."

"What was the business you were to carry out to-night?" I interrupted
once more. "Are you trying to talk out the time, under the idea that
you'll be rescued, or something of that sort?"

"I'm coming to it now," replied Parker sulkily. "It's you as keeps
putting me off with interruptions. There's a club what they call
'The Millionaires' Club.' There aren't many in it--seven, I think the
Dumpling said; but they're all millionaires, and all of 'em was quite
poor men once, poor as me and Smudgy. Now they've got millions, and
live in mansions in Park Lane, and has ten-course dinners off gold and
silver plates. But I say, Mr. Grant, can't I be untied now? I'm numb
with cold and with lying here so long. I've very nearly finished my
story, and, if you'll loose me, I'll promise to finish it faithful to
the end."

"There's no reason why you shouldn't have your ankles free and sit up,"
I said, hauling in the sculls and laying them alongside as I stooped
to unfasten the rope that was lashed about Parker's feet. "We'll talk
about taking the handcuffs off when you've done. Go on--I'm listening.
This knot here's rather tight, but I can hear what you say while I'm
undoing it."

"Once a month," continued Parker, whilst I was tugging at the
knot, "these millionaires meet secretly in the back parlour in a
public-house out Shadwell way, and have a feed o' tripe and onions,
or pigs' trotters or chitlings or faggots, or stewed eels or fried
fish, or something of that sort, and drink four half out of pint
pots, and smoke shag tobacco in clay pipes, and play shove-ha'penny
and pitch-and-toss for coppers. It's coming off to-night, this Crœsus
bean-feast and blow-out, as the Dumpling calls it; and he's planned
to kidnap one of 'em on their way home, and make him pay a thumping
big sum for ransom money. The place was to be---- Hi! Look out, there!
There's a big ship coming out of the fog just behind you. My God! She's
on us. And me tied up like this! Let me loose, for Christ's sake! It's
murder. It's----"

Simultaneously with a sudden crash--under the impact of which the boat
seemed to shiver like a live thing--the blurred fog-blinded lights on
the river banks broke into zigzagging globes of yellow light that shot
backwards and forwards, upward and downward and sideways before my
eyes, as gnats dart and dance and dodge among themselves on a summer
eve. Then these lights all ran together into a streak of yellow fire.
The boat seemed to leap forward and to rise under us, as a horse which
has staggered to its knees, when hit by a bullet, strives to struggle
forward and to its feet under its rider; and the next instant the
frail craft went to pieces and fell away from under us.

In that instant I saw the ghastly face of Parker staring up
horror-stricken at what looked like the high and perpendicular side
of a house which was about to fall upon us, and that, in the act of
overtoppling, seemed momentarily to hang and hover and brood gloatingly
above our head. Then there came the deadly and numbing chill of
ice-cold and rushing water that sucked us down and under, as if to the
falling house's very foundations.



I AM SNUBBED BY SCOTLAND YARD.


It was "murder," as Parker had said. Even as I went down I was
conscious of the horror, of the inhumanity, of letting a poor devil,
tied hand and foot like a dog in a sack, go to his doom with never
a chance of making a fight for his life. For myself, being a fair
swimmer, and accustomed to a cold dip in rough seas, winter and summer,
I was in no such fear as entirely to lose my presence of mind. The
danger lay, of course, in my being sucked under the ship's bottom and
drowned before I could make my way to the surface; but as the steamer
was going very slowly and had taken us side-on, rather than with the
prow, I managed in a very few seconds to get clear of her wash, and up,
with open eyes, on the top of the water. Apparently no one on board the
steamer was aware that she had struck and sunk a rowing boat, for she
went slowly but steadily on her way, as if nothing had happened. Had we
not chanced to enter a fog bank a few minutes before the collision,
and had I not been engaged in loosening Parker's bonds, the probability
is that the accident would not have occurred. What most concerned me,
however, was not the cause of the mishap, but the whereabouts of poor
Parker. Again and again I crossed and re-crossed the subsiding wash of
the vessel's wake; again and again I halloed and called the unhappy
man by name; but all, alas, to no purpose. Except for the answering
bark of a dog from a barge in-shore, the hooting of the steamer's
fog-horn, and the washing of the water, there was no reply, and, being
somewhat exhausted, I gave up the search and struck out for the nearest
shore. It had been slack water for the last half-hour, and the tide
was, fortunately for me, only just upon the turn; so, without being
carried far out of my course, I was able to reach the river's bank in
safety. Wet as I was, I could not walk the streets without attracting
attention, but, luckily for me, the very first vehicle which came
along was a doctor's carriage. I shouted to the driver to stop, and
explaining my plight to his master by saying I had been run down in
the fog while on the river, asked him to be so very good as to drive
me to the police station. He not only consented, but plied me with a
restorative of some sort which he had in his bag; and when I reached
the station I was, except for a shivering fit, not very much the worse
for my wetting. There, while I was having a rub down and changing into
the clothes--a policeman's uniform--which was provided for me, I told
my story. The superintendent was very civil. He said he was aware
of the existence of the opium den in question, but otherwise knew
of nothing criminal in connection with it, but would at once send a
sufficient number of men to raid the place. He also rang up the river
police on the telephone, suggesting that a boat should be sent out
in search of Parker's body, and instructed a plain-clothes officer
to accompany me in a cab to the address which I gave as my lodging.
Whether this was done in order to verify the address, and because he
suspected the truth of my story, I did not know, and did not care. It
was a reasonable enough precaution to take, and, having nothing to
conceal, I did not resent his taking it, and, indeed, was not sorry to
have a companion upon my journey, for, now that the excitement which
had buoyed me up was passing, I began to feel somewhat exhausted.

Next morning I took cab to Scotland Yard, where I sent in my name and
business, and was at once received in audience by one of the heads. He
greeted me courteously, heard my story out, interpolating a few shrewd
and pointed questions now and then, and occasionally making a note.

When I had come to an end of my narrative he bowed gravely, and said:

"Thank you, Mr. Rissler. The superintendent at the station where you
called has already communicated with us in regard to your statement.
I'm not sure that what you have told us will be of any practical
assistance, except in so far as it confirms what we already know. But
we are obliged to you in any case. You have done rightly in coming
to us. We will communicate with you should we want your further
assistance. We have your address, I think? Thank you very much. Good
morning."

"You know this man, the Dumpling, as they call him?" I inquired
eagerly, ignoring my dismissal.

"Perfectly."

"What is there against him?"

"Nothing--absolutely nothing. He holds views which in some countries
would get him into trouble, but in England one can talk anarchy or
anything else as much as one likes, so long as one's actions keep
within the law. And he keeps doubtful company. In fact, I may go so far
as to say that we suspect him of knowing something beforehand of more
than one outrage with which we have had to deal, though we have not yet
been able to implicate him directly."

"And what's his name?" I asked.

Scotland Yard, as personified in the official before me, lifted its
eyebrows and shrugged its shoulders.

"Really, Mr. Rissler, I don't think I must answer any more questions.
As I have said, you have done quite right in coming to us, though you
haven't told us anything we didn't know before. But the matter is in
the hands of Detective Grant, and I think you may safely leave it
there."

"Oh, yes," I said. "Grant's a good man. He's a friend of mine. We
worked together, he and I, in more than one case in the past."

"Indeed!"

Scotland Yard did not seem particularly interested in these
autobiographical details, either about myself or about Grant.

"Indeed," it repeated with an air of bland boredom, rising from its
chair to indicate that the interview was at an end.

"I've done some detective work myself, as you perhaps know," I went on;
"and having been pitchforked, as it were, into this particular case,
I'm more than inclined to see if I can make anything of it; in which
case, should I discover anything, I should, of course, acquaint you
with my discoveries, so that we could co-operate together."

"You are very considerate," replied Scotland Yard, sarcastically;
"but I fancy we are tolerably competent to do our work without
outside assistance. I've heard of you, Mr. Rissler. You do a little
investigation on your own account, don't you?--and then write stories
about it after. Well, with the story-writing I have no fault to find. I
haven't read any of your stories, but I'm told they are quite harmless.
But, really, don't you think this is a case which is best let alone by
amateurs? We can't stop you from interfering as they do in medicine,
where quacks are pulled up pretty sharp by the law, but if you take my
advice you'll let the detection of crime alone, except in novels, where
I have no doubt you acquit yourself very creditably. But really I can't
spare any more time for further discussion. Again we are obliged to you
for having come to us with your story. If anything should transpire to
make it necessary to communicate with you again, you shall hear from
us. Good morning."

"Quacks!" I said to myself, angrily, as I stalked out with my head in
the air. "I've been the means, as they know, of bringing more than one
criminal to justice, and here I'm called a quack by a supercilious
representative of officialdom."

Outside in Whitehall I called a cab.

"---- police station," I said. "You can wait and bring me back, so
don't raise your eyebrows. If I don't come back, I'll pay your fare all
the same."

"Right, sir," he said, evidently in good spirits at the prospect of a
long and lucrative job, the good spirits in question being manifested
at somebody else's expense.

"What! _both_ of you awake!" he called out in surprised astonishment
to a couple of carmen who blocked his way for a moment with their vans.

Then, chuckling at the fact that a somewhat limited vocabulary could
not bear the strain which an apparently unlimited knowledge of his
family tree placed upon it, and so necessitated the inclusion and
description of himself and his entire ancestry in one simple and
comprehensive colour-scheme, he whipped up his horse, and directed its
head eastward.



"WANTED" BY THE POLICE.


On the previous night the police superintendent at ---- had treated
me with a courtesy which was almost deferential; and had himself
accompanied me to my cab to say:

"Good-night, sir, and I hope you'll be none the worse for your wetting."

Witnessing my rather ceremonious "send off," the very young and perhaps
recently-enlisted member of the force, on duty in the outer office,
had evidently been duly impressed with the fact that I was a person of
some weight. On my presenting myself at the station next morning, he
greeted me with a smile of obsequious respect, and without waiting to
report my call to the superintendent, conducted me importantly, and
with a great air of knowing when and to whom to accord honour, straight
into the august presence of his chief. The somewhat officious air with
which he announced "Mr. Rissler, sir," was speedily changed into a
look of blank and crest-fallen surprise, for instead of receiving me as
a favoured caller, the superintendent--who, as we entered, had his ear
glued to the telephone--jumped up in a passion, and shouted:

"How dare you show this person, or any person, into my room without
permission?"

Looking at me viciously, as at one who had been guilty of the crime of
obtaining a respectful reception under false pretences, the unfortunate
constable stammered out:

"Very sorry, sir; but thought that the gentlem--person--was a friend
of yours." And, saluting with a proper air of chastened humility, he
withdrew.

Scarcely had the door closed behind him before the telephone bell
clashed its discordant jangling at the superintendent's very ear,
jarring the nerves of both of us, and causing him almost to jump in his
shoes.

Then I "tumbled" to the situation. If I was not very much mistaken,
he had been in communication with Scotland Yard at the moment of my
entrance, the subject of the conference being none other than my
humble self; and, judging by the marked difference in my reception,
and by the way in which, with one ear stooped to the telephone, he was
glaring at me with both eyes, his last night's reception of myself and
his communicativeness had not come in for his chief's commendation.
That he had been receiving something of a jacketing his first few words
told.

"Are you there? Oh, it's you, sir, again--is it? Yes, sir, I did hear
what you said just now, and am very sorry. What do you say? No, sir, I
didn't leave the telephone before you had done speaking. I shouldn't
think of doing such a thing, but somebody came into my room and
interrupted me. Will you excuse me a second, sir, while I turn them
out? Then I think I can explain why I acted as I did."

Without taking his ear from the telephone, and without saying a word,
he pointed me peremptorily to the door, seeing which, I of course
instantly withdrew to the outer office, where I was surveyed with
supercilious scorn by the youthful constable, who a few minutes before
had so deferentially ushered me into the superintendent's room. Turning
my back contemptuously upon him, I studied a board upon which were
displayed the portraits of certain characters "wanted" by the police.
The young constable, who apparently attributed his downfall from
official favour to a malicious and deeply-laid plot on my part, sought,
in vulgar parlance, "to get back a bit of his own" by affecting to find
a resemblance between some of the "wanteds" and myself, examining first
their faces, and then my features, with an interest which I could not
but consider offensive.

Obviously the only card left for me to play was to appear unconscious
of the comparison which he was instituting, and while I was doing this
to the best of what I fear was a poor ability, the door opened, and the
superintendent came out.

"You want to see me, Mr.--er--Rissler, isn't it?" he inquired rudely.
"What is it? I've no time to spare this morning."

"I won't keep you long," I said. "But you were good enough to say last
night that you would send some of your men to inspect the opium den,
and I called in to hear what happened, and to ask whether Parker's body
had been found."

"You called to hear what had happened, and to ask this, and to ask
that!" he said insolently. "Since when have you been appointed to the
head office in New Scotland Yard, that you come here to cross-examine
me on my own business? Pretty fine pass the force is coming to,
if we're to take every Tom, Dick, and Harry into our confidence.
I've nothing to tell you, sir, except to advise you to confine your
attention to your own business, and leave other people to attend to
their own. Good morning."

Turning on his heel he walked into his room again, slamming the door
behind him; so, affecting not to see the insolent grin on the face
of my friend the youthful constable, who had been present during my
snubbing, I put my hat on my head and stepped into the street.

"But I'll find out the result of the raiding of the den yet," I said
to myself. "The superintendent here, and his men, were friendly enough
to me last night, and I strongly suspect that the orders to tell me
nothing have only just arrived from New Scotland Yard. If I can find
the policeman within whose beat the den is, it is possible that he has
not yet received instructions that I'm to be kept in the dark, and that
half-a-crown may open his mouth. Anyhow, it can do no harm to have a
try."

Nor was I wrong in my conjecture. The policeman--when I found him,
which I did with little difficulty--was friendly and communicative.

"Oh, you're the gent, are you, sir, who laid the information about
the opium den? I wasn't at the station when you called, but I came in
directly after, and heard the superintendent talking about it. He'd
be glad to see you, I think, sir, if you was to look in. Oh, yes; he
sent five men round to the place at once. But, Lord, sir, the rascals
had got wind of it, and when our men got there, the birds had flown.
Cleared out--that's what they had, every man Jack of them. There was
the broken window, just as you said, and there was the marks on the
door, a-showin' as somebody had tried to break it in, or to batter it
down, but them as had been there had all cleared out, and they'd taken
the chemicals and tools and other things, what you saw there with 'em.
The chief he's trying to track the rascals down, and to find where
they've moved to, for they must have put them things somewhere. It
stands to reason they can't walk about with them in the street. But
though he clapped two of our best men on the job, they hadn't found
anything when I came out on beat."

"And Parker's body?" I inquired. "Has it been found?"

"Not as I've heard on, sir. But holloa, what's this?"

The constable and I had been strolling on together while talking, and
on turning the corner of a small and evil-smelling street we saw a knot
of people gathered outside a sweet shop.

"Now, then! What's all this? Stand aside there, will you?" he
commanded, shouldering the crowd aside.

At the door a wretched hag, her lank grey hair falling in dishevelled
wisps upon her shoulders, and the pores of her face so choked with dirt
that the grime lay in lines along the wrinkles, was clawing at the
air with one skinny hand and arm, alternately sobbing and screaming
hysterically.

"Come, come, my good woman!" said the constable sharply. "Stop that
noise, and tell me what it's all about."

Shaking her head, as if to convey that she was powerless to speak, the
wretched creature clutched wildly at the door lintel, and then fell in
a swoon almost at his feet.

"Who is the woman? And what's the trouble?" inquired the constable of
the bystanders. "Do any of you know her?"

"Macintyre's her name," volunteered a respectable looking woman in
the crowd. "She keeps the sweet shop inside, and lets her rooms as
lodgings. I never heard anything against her. But I don't know what's
the matter. She'd only just come out into the street before you came."

"She lives here, does she?" inquired the constable. "Stand aside there,
and I'll have a look inside and see if anything's wrong."

Then a small voice, that sounded quite near to the pavement, shrilled
from the spot where the crowd pressed thickest.

It came from a wee, wizened girl-child, who looked as if she might be
ten and talked with the precision and self-possession of twenty--so
pitifully sharpened do the wits of the children of the streets become
in the struggle for existence.

"It's my Granny--that's who it is. She's got a lodger in the back room,
Black Sam. Somebody gave him two shillings yesterday, and he came home
drunk last night, quite early, and went to bed. I know he was drunk,
for two gentlemen came to see him about ten, but Granny told them he
was in bed, and drunk, in the back room, and they couldn't see him till
this morning. I heard a funny noise in his room in the night. It woke
me up. It sounded like someone trying to scream, and not being able to;
and I thought I heard people moving about. So I woke Granny up and told
her so, but she was cross with me for waking her, and said it was only
his drunken snoring I'd heard. But just now, as Black Sam didn't get
up, Granny and I went into his room. The window was wide open, and Sam
was lying on the floor all over blood. And please, sir, there's a big
hole in his throat, and he's quite cold, and I think he's dead."

"Black Sam!" Surely I had heard that name before? Why, yes, and no
longer ago than on the preceding evening. When the leader of the gang
in the opium den had asked me who it was that directed me there, I had
replied, "A negro match-seller, whom I saw outside Poplar station." His
comment had been "Ah! a negro match-seller--and outside Poplar station.
I think I know the fellow. We must look into this!"

Then his confederates had whispered together, the only words that I had
overheard being the dead man's name, "Black Sam." Two of the gang had
then left the house, as if on some errand. That was, I remembered--for
the clock struck soon after--just before ten. It was at ten that two
men had called to see the negro. They had been told that he had come
home drunk, and was lying in the back room asleep. Was it they who had
entered that room by the window in the dead of the night and murdered
him?



"DEAD MAN'S POINT."


As the murder of Black Sam plays no further part in this story, I do
not propose to describe in detail the ghastly scene which presented
itself when, in company with the police officer, I entered the death
chamber.

Sensational enough, and more than enough, this narrative of the hunting
down of a master-criminal must necessarily be, without the gratuitous
description of scenes--no matter how impressive--which have no direct
bearing upon my story. Of the murder of Black Sam it was necessary
to tell as much as I have told, if the reader is to follow, step by
step, my first meeting, and my final struggle with, the man around
whom the narrative centres. When to what I have already related, I add
that, whatever the motive for the crime, the subsequent investigation
established the fact that the motive was at least not robbery, we
may dismiss the murder of Black Sam from memory, and pass on to my
efforts to get upon the trail of the man who was the instigator of the
crime--the man whose acquaintance I had so eventfully, if casually,
made on the occasion of my visit to the opium den.

My first step must, of course, be to get into communication with
Grant. Until I had seen him, and learnt his views, I did not feel
free seriously to enter upon the case at all. That he already had it
in hand, I had been told by New Scotland Yard, and that he was making
progress was clear from the fact that, disguised as a Chinaman, he
had contrived to enter the meeting-place of the gang, possibly even
to overhear some of their plans. It is not likely that, without very
strong actual or presumptive evidence of their guilt, he would have
bidden me make my way to the nearest police station, and ask, in his
name, that a body of men be sent to make prisoners of the entire gang.
Grant was a private detective, not a New Scotland Yard man; but he was
perhaps the only private detective whom New Scotland Yard can be said
to have recognised. He had been of such frequent assistance to the
chiefs of the Criminal Investigation Department, and his relations
with them were so friendly, that his standing had come to be in a
sense semi-official, and no reasonable request by him was likely to be
refused.

If, on communicating with him, I found that he had, as seemed probable,
the case more or less complete, I should, of course, recognise that
his was the prior right, and that any interference on my part, except
by his invitation or his permission, would be an impertinence. If,
however, as I hoped, he had still links to fill in, before completing
the chain, my intention was to ask him to allow me to work in
connection with him. It has been said by a great thinker that "the
things that are for you, gravitate towards you," and judging by the way
in which the Fates had involved me--as by some law of gravitation--into
the matter of the opium den mystery, the working out of that mystery to
its unravelment seemed to be my destiny.

In the meantime, where was Grant? I had left him in the den, disguised
as a Chinaman, his identity apparently unsuspected even by the Dumpling.

It is, of course, within the bounds of possibility that the Dumpling
had all the time known perfectly well that my story of having come to
the den merely in search of "copy" was likely to be true, and that the
supposed Chinaman upstairs, smoking opium, was in reality Detective
Grant. I say, it is within the bounds of possibility that it is so,
but in my own mind I was entirely convinced that the identity of Grant
with the Chinaman was quite unsuspected. If that were so, the fact
that I had made good my escape from the den would cause--and evidently
had caused--something like a panic among the members of the gang. It
was no doubt because they believed me to be Grant, and knew me to be
uninjured and at large, that, within an hour or two of my escape, they
had cleared out of the den, taking all their effects with them.

In the meantime--to repeat the question I have already put--where was
Grant? Had he, after I had gone that evening, said or done anything
to arouse suspicion, and been murdered by the Dumpling's orders? Or
had he been allowed to depart, unsuspected and unharmed? And was his
present mysterious disappearance due to the fact that he had followed
up the gang after the flight, and was still engaged in watching
their movements and in completing the chain of evidence against
them? For that he had--either of his own, or of somebody else's
choosing--vanished, and left no trace behind, was absolutely certain. I
had gone straight from the scene of the negro's murder to the nearest
post office, and had wired to Grant's chambers in Adelphi Terrace,
asking for an appointment, and that a reply be sent immediately to the
Savage Club, where I intended to lunch. Arrived at the club I found
Grant's man-servant awaiting me. He said that his master had gone out
the previous morning, and had neither returned nor sent a message.
There was, of course, nothing unusual in this, for a detective's
goings and comings are necessarily uncertain; but, remembering the
circumstances under which I had last seen my friend, I could not help
feeling uneasy.

In a restless mood I strolled out of the club and walked City-wards,
along the Embankment. From the headquarters of an evening newspaper,
in the neighbourhood of Tudor Street, the newsboys were rushing,
shouting as they ran, and making of the place a very Babel with their
bellowings.

"'Ere y'are, sir! Terrible river tragedy! Three bodies found in the
Thames this morning!"

Purchasing a paper from the nearest boy, I scanned it eagerly,
anxiously. Beyond a paragraph recording the bare fact that the bodies
of three men, supposed to be sailors, had been found at Dead Man's
Point, Canvey Island, the spot where the corpses of those drowned in
the Thames are sometimes washed ashore, there was little to satisfy my
curiosity. I had not walked a score of yards before a fresh bevy of
newsboys burst from another newspaper distributing centre.

"Spesh'l!" they yelled. "Great river mystery! Three persons drowned in
the Thames! Mysterious circumstances! Suspected murder! 'Ere y'are,
Sir! Spesh'l! Latest particulars!"

Again I purchased a paper, to find, in the stop-press portion of the
print, the following paragraph:

 "THE GREAT RIVER MYSTERY.

 "_The bodies have been removed to 'The Lobster Smack Inn,' Hole Haven,
 Canvey Island, to await identification._"

In my present mood, action of some sort was imperative, and as a
cab was passing, I hailed it, and calling out "Fenchurch Street
Station--fast as you can," jumped in.

At Fenchurch I took the first train to Benfleet, ferrying over the
creek which at high tide separates Canvey from the mainland, and making
my way across the island to the "Lobster Smack" at Hole Haven, where I
asked to be allowed to see the bodies.

They were lying in an outhouse, side by side, each figure decently
covered by a cloth. The first to be exposed I recognised without
surprise, and at a glance, as that of the hapless Parker. He was
dressed just as he had been when I last saw him, and with the handcuffs
still on his wrists.

The second body was, to the best of my belief, that of his late
associate, Smudgy. I could not swear to the features, for Smudgy had
been stationed at the top of the staircase while I was in the opium
den, and I had kept too close an eye upon the Dumpling, and the man who
had remained with him in the room, to pay much attention to what was
going on outside. Unless I was very much mistaken, however, the shabby
greeny-fawn dust coat and the frayed shepherds' plaid trousers were
the same which I had seen upon one of the two men who had remained on
guard at the head of the stairs, and had afterwards been despatched,
in company with Parker, to cut off my retreat at the back of the
house. When I had last seen him, he had been in full flight across the
moon-lit space of waste land, and in a direction away from the river.
Whether he was dead or alive when he got into the water, or how he
came to be there at all, I had no means of knowing, and could only
conjecture that, finding he had been duped, and fearing the Dumpling's
anger on hearing of my escape, Smudgy had returned to the river in
search of myself and Parker, and had been accidentally drowned. The
third body was next uncovered. Apparently the corpse, in its passage
down the river, had been caught by the screw of a passing steamer,
and so cut and crushed as to be unrecognisable. The bones of all the
limbs were twisted and broken, the body beaten almost into a pulp, and
the whole of the face sliced off, as if by a stroke of the steamer's
swiftly revolving screw.

Then, for the first and, I hope, last time in my life, I
fainted--fainted from sheer horror, for around the otherwise naked
body was a leather belt from which a ragged inch of what had once been
trousering still clung. Looking more closely, I saw that it was of
blue silk, with tiny zigzagged threads of silver interwoven. Not many
hours ago I had seen a man who, to my positive knowledge, always wore
a leather belt (he had at one time been a sailor) around his waist. He
had then been clad in Chinese trousering of the identical pattern--blue
silk with a tiny zigzagged thread of interwoven silver. That man was
my unhappy friend, Robert Grant, and, looking again at the body, I saw
that some sort of yellow dye had recently been used to stain the face
and hands and neck.



I TURN BURGLAR.


As I had now decided to devote myself to finding the man known as
the Dumpling, and to the clearing up of the mystery of my friend's
death and of the opium den, the first question to be asked (it was
the question I put to myself as I walked away from the inn) was,
"Did the Dumpling really believe me to be Grant?" If that were so,
it was possible that Grant had to the last successfully maintained
his disguise, and had met his death accidentally while shadowing the
fugitives, who had probably made their escape by way of the water. Or
it was possible that, without suspecting the supposed Chinaman to be
Grant, something may have happened after my departure to arouse the
Dumpling's suspicions in regard to Grant's good faith, in which case
short work would no doubt be made of the intruder.

What was more likely, for instance, than that, hearing the uproar
downstairs, after I had locked myself in the kitchen, and fearing
that I was being murdered, Grant had rushed down to my assistance, and
so betrayed himself? In which case, the Dumpling would have made no
bones about knocking him on the head, or otherwise despatching him and
throwing the body into the river. But, apart from the question whether
my friend had met his death by accident or by intention, the facts
seemed to justify me in assuming that the Dumpling had really believed
me to be Grant, the detective. The reader will remember that, after I
had locked myself in the kitchen, the Dumpling had called out, "Don't
say you haven't killed your man! He mustn't leave the place alive. It's
Robert Grant, the detective. I had word that he'd tracked us, and meant
trying to get in here to-night."

All this seemed strongly to point to the fact that the Dumpling _did_
indeed believe me to be the hated detective. How he had got wind of
Grant's intention to effect an entrance to the den, or how Grant
had contrived successfully to effect that entrance, and to disarm
suspicion, I did not know; but, supposing that news of the threatened
danger had only reached the ears of the Dumpling a few moments before
my arrival, and before he had time to turn his suspicions in other
directions--the fact that the news was followed by the entrance of
a suspicious stranger, who could give no better explanation for his
presence than a lame and apparently trumped-up story about a commission
to write a magazine article on opium dens, would certainly lend colour
to the assumption that I was the expected man. The determined and
desperate efforts which had subsequently been made to murder me, all
seemed to point the same way; and I decided to start my investigation
by assuming that the Dumpling and his accomplices had believed, and
still believed, me to be none other than Robert Grant, the detective.

If that were so, my escape would cause something like a panic among
them, and would lead to their taking immediate steps to discover my
whereabouts, and to put me out of the way. The first of these immediate
steps would be to set a watch upon Grant's house; and to discover
whether this was being done, must be my very first business. The fact
that Grant's house was being watched--unless, of course, I could
satisfy myself that the watching was being done by the police--would
not only go far to prove the accuracy of my theory, but would also
be the means of putting me upon the track of the Dumpling or of his
accomplices.

Naturally, I had to go to work very carefully. Were I, even if
skilfully disguised, to do so much as walk twice, or even once, up the
street in which Grant's house was situated, I should be in danger of
attracting attention. Shadowing the house by concealing myself in dark
doorways and lurking around corners, was quite out of the question, and
the common plan of posing as a lodger, and hiring a room or rooms in an
opposite or neighbouring house, would be equally impracticable.

Even if I commissioned a friend to make the necessary inquiries,
I should have to take possession of my lodgings--if suitable
lodgings with a view of the street were found, which was by no means
certain--more or less openly; and having once taken possession, I could
not get in and out without attracting attention.

Everyone who knows the West End of London is familiar with the somewhat
shabby side streets which borrow gentility and grandeur from the
fact that they are situated near, or off, a fashionable square, from
which they take their name. Grant lived in Taunton Place, a modest
little street consisting of two rows of small houses which abutted
upon the many mansions of aristocratic Taunton Square. Driving through
Taunton Place, sitting well back and out of sight in the recesses of
a four-wheel cab, I observed an empty house on the opposite side of
the way to Grant's, and almost at the corner where Taunton Place and
Taunton Square converged. Waiting till night had set in, I burgled this
empty house from the back, and began my watch.

The result was in every way satisfactory. Grant's house was undoubtedly
being watched, and by a man who, it was not difficult to see, was
doing double duty. He was keeping a constant eye not only upon No. 10,
Taunton Place, where Grant resided, but also upon a big, pretentious,
bow-windowed and pillar-porticoed mansion known as No. 5, Taunton
Square.

Again and again I saw him pass the windows of the big house and look
in; again and again I saw him watching, from his corner, everyone who
called either at No. 10, Taunton Place, or at No. 5, Taunton Square.

After a time a well-dressed man walked up to No. 5, Taunton Square,
knocked, and, when the door was opened, entered. He remained there
for twenty minutes, and when he came out was promptly followed by the
shadower. The coast being thus clear, I left my own post, and on making
inquiries at a tavern where I called for a glass of beer, was told
that No. 5, Taunton Square had recently been taken by a gentleman from
America, named Carleton, a widower and reputed millionaire, who lived
there with his daughter, Kate, and his unmarried sister. Here again
was an interesting discovery which promised developments. The hapless
Parker had told me of seven millionaires who once a month repaired
to a tavern in Shadwell, where they dined upon humble fare, drank
"four half" out of pint pots, and smoked shag tobacco in clay pipes.
It did not seem to be an improbable story, and, personally, I had a
secret and sneaking sympathy--due possibly to my own low tastes--with
anything which promised so complete and sensible a return to nature. I
have myself partaken--not lavishly, perhaps, but with gusto--of malt
liquors, served in pewter pots in country taverns, have smacked my lips
(another evidence of a debased nature), and have sat back in my chair,
sighing with replete contentment, and possibly with an inner man by
no means indifferently fortified by that excellent complement to good
beer--bread and cheese. At such times I have called life good, and have
found myself in peace and charity with all my neighbours.

Did all self-made millionaires renew their youth, and remind themselves
of their struggling days, by becoming members of the club of which
Parker had spoken, they would afterwards, I am persuaded, return to the
scene of their splendour in a humble and chastened frame of mind, which
might possibly prompt them to do something more permanent, and more
sensible, for their less fortunate fellow creatures than the founding
of free libraries. I may add that I do not claim any copyright in the
idea, and that should Mr. Andrew Carnegie be as assiduous a reader of
my instructive writings as it is to be hoped a gentleman so interested
in the free circulation of sound literature should be, he need fear no
action for infringement of copyright, should he be disposed to devote
the remainder of his--I fear--fast vanishing millions to such a purpose.

But to return to my story.

According to Parker's statement, the Dumpling, whose studies of natural
history had possibly led him to the conclusion that every creature
which comes into the world is so constituted that other and smaller
creatures should prey upon it, had so far fallen in with the existing
scheme of things as to decide to play the part of a plutocratic
parasite. His plan was forcibly to kidnap a millionaire when on his
way to or from the Shadwell banquet, and to hold him to ransom for an
immense sum, which was to go into the pockets of the Dumpling and his
accomplices. The fact, then, that a shadower--presumably acting on
behalf of Dumpling and Company--was carefully watching the house of a
millionaire, seemed not only to confirm the truth of Parker's story,
but to point to the very man whom the Dumpling intended to kidnap and
to bleed.

To trap a fox, it is of service to know upon which particular
chicken-house he is concentrating his attention.

While Brer Fox Dumpling was engaged in stalking and carrying off Brer
Rooster Millionaire, Brer Rabbit Rissler might, by keeping an eye upon
Brer Rooster, succeed in learning the whereabouts of, and ultimately in
stalking and trapping, Brer Fox himself. For the moment the Dumpling's
shadower was off duty, as regards the watch he was keeping upon No. 10,
Taunton Place and No. 5, Taunton Square; being engaged, as I had reason
to know, in following up the caller at Mr. Carleton's house.

Having satisfied myself that no understudy had come to take the
shadower's place or to relieve guard, I jumped into the first
four-wheeler that passed.

"Drive to No. 5, Taunton Square," I said to the cabby, "and when we are
there, get down and knock at the door. Meanwhile, I'll wait in the cab
till the door's opened, so that I can slip in at once. If anybody asks
you who I am and where you took me up, say at the Hotel Cecil, and that
you think I'm on a company-promoting job, as you have driven me already
to the houses of half a dozen company-director millionaires. Here's
half-a-crown--no, I'll make it two half-crowns, if you do as I tell
you, and hold your tongue."

With a nod and a grin he opened the cab-door and I got in. In less than
two minutes we were at No. 5, Taunton Square, and the instant the door
of the house was opened, in reply to the driver's knock, I was out of
the cab and had slipped inside and shut the door behind me, before the
astonished flunkey could as much as ask my name.

"Is Mr. Carleton in?" I snapped. "I've got some very important news for
him, and must see him without a moment's delay."

I spoke authoritatively, even sharply, and in no way as a stranger who
is unassured of his welcome.

"No, sir," the fellow answered respectfully. "He isn't in just now."

"When will he be?" I demanded.

"Well, sir, that's just what I can't say. If you'll take a seat in the
library, I'll ask Miss Kate if she has any news. She'll be----"

"Yes," I said peremptorily, "that'll do. Take me to her at once. Don't
delay in sending up word. There's not an instant to lose. Take me to
her straight."

Somewhat doubtfully, but scarcely liking to disobey one who spoke with
so confident an air, the man led the way to a door at the end of the
hall, and was just about to knock when it opened, and I saw standing
before me none other than my Lady of the Lake.

"Forgive this intrusion," I said, "but I bring you news of your father."

"I am relieved to hear it," she answered cordially, but quite coolly.
"It is very strange that he should neither have returned last night nor
sent a message. You are sure that he is safe and well?"

For the moment I was so taken aback that I faltered. Was I, then, too
late? Had the Dumpling already carried out his villainous purpose?
Then, pulling myself together, I answered, cheerfully:

"Yes, he is safe and well--make yourself quite easy about that; and I
know with whom he is staying. I will tell you all about it, if you will
allow me."

"Please come in," she said.



"WHAT'S YOUR LITTLE GAME?"


Then she recognised me. Except for the fact that her face suddenly
flamed and then as suddenly hardened, her breeding stood her in good
stead, and with cold, clear eyes, which looked as indifferently into
mine as if I had been a stranger calling to solicit a subscription to
some charity, she pointed me to a chair.

"You bring me news of my father?" she inquired, with a composure which
was possibly assumed for my benefit, or, rather, for my discomfiture.

"That is why I am here," I answered, bowing gravely, and in my turn
assuming an indifference which I strove to make as studied as her own.

"He is safe and well," I went on. "Of that let me assure you
positively. He is detained only upon a matter of business, and but for
the fact that other people, as well as himself, are concerned in it, he
could return, if he chose, this very night."

This much I said to allay her anxiety. That it was a diplomatic rather
than an exact statement of the facts, I do not deny, but though I would
unhesitatingly have told a lie to spare her, I was at least within the
truth in saying that the moment of Mr. Carleton's return lay entirely
within his own choice, since, once he had consented to pay the ransom
demanded by the Dumpling--and the money, as well as the safety of his
kidnappers, was secured--Mr. Carleton would in all probability be set
at liberty, and could then return, as I had said. Into the question
whether he would or would not consent thus to be bled of a large sum
of money, I had no intention of entering. The business before me was
to break the bad news as gently and as gradually as possible; and in
breaking bad news it does not always do to blurt out the undiluted
truth.

"Thank you," she said stiffly. "I wonder, in that case, that my father
did not communicate with me himself. Am I to understand that you are
his messenger? And am I to content myself with the bare knowledge, and
only on your assurance, that my father is detained on business, and
may or may not return to-night?"

"That's as you choose, Miss Carleton," I made answer, somewhat
foolishly.

"You have the advantage of me, sir," she replied icily, "for, to the
best of my belief, you and I have never met before. Is that not so?"

It is a woman's prerogative to forget or to remember, as her instinct
or her inclinations dictates, and, in view of the somewhat unusual and
unconventional circumstances of our first meeting, I was by no means
sure that I did not like and admire her the more, rather than the
less, for the way in which she had met the situation. Unhesitatingly I
fathered the lie, and with similar hardihood.

"That is so," I replied coldly.

Rightly or wrongly, I fancied that she softened slightly, so feeling
that I should do myself more justice if I told my story while her
manner was less freezing, I came to the point at once.

"May I tell you what I know, and how I came to know, of the business
which has detained your father?" I inquired. "I shall not keep you many
minutes."

"I shall be curious to hear it," she answered, speaking more
graciously than hitherto, and, seating herself in a dark corner where I
could not see her face, she prepared to listen.

I told the thing well, better--though, of course, much more
briefly--than I have told it in these pages, for the excitement with
which she listened, suppressed and controlled though it was, seemed to
communicate itself to me. The only moment when she bristled, if I may
use so inapplicable a word about so lovely a woman, was at the start.

"All that I have to tell has happened within the last twenty-four
hours," I began, "for only yesterday I was taking a country holiday,
and, I fear, kicking up my heels like a mischievous colt who has broken
out of bounds, and is sadly in need of a sound whipping to teach him
to behave himself. But," I made haste to get on, for the air around
me seemed suddenly to turn chilly, "since then, short time ago as it
is, I have had a 'breaking in,' and been made to answer to lash and
spur, and to look death in the face, and to fight for my life, in so
extraordinary a way, that my only fear is you'll not believe my story
when you hear it."

Then I told of my recall to town, of my commission to visit the opium
den, and of the subsequent happenings up to the moment when I had
stepped out of the cab and into her house. As I brought my recital to a
close, the door opened, and a lumpy-figured, masculine-looking woman,
hard-faced, large-featured, entered the room. Her skin was rough,
red and grained like brick-dust, and on either cheek was a patch of
darker red--almost of purple--which might have been put on by means of
a stencil plate, so hard, so abrupt, and so definite were the lines
where it began or ended. An incipient moustache and a deep voice seemed
to enter a protest, less against the petticoats she was wearing than
against her small and well-formed hands and feet.

"Clara!" she exclaimed menacingly, "who is this?"

Knowing that Miss Carleton's name was Kate, I was somewhat astonished
to hear her thus addressed, for it was not until later that I learned
the facts. The elder lady, who was Miss Carleton's only aunt, had
felt not a little aggrieved that her niece had not been called after
herself. So, by way of entering a protest against the omission of
the compliment which she felt ought to have been paid to her, and
notwithstanding Mr. Carleton's annoyance, and the fact that everybody
else called the girl Kate, the elder lady insisted upon addressing her
niece as Clara, as though the girl were actually her namesake.

"Clara!" she repeated. "Who is this?"

The rising remonstrant inflexion which she placed upon her niece's
name, and the way in which she said "Who is this?" her deep voice
booming like a three-peal bell, sounding first a high, then a low, and
then a deep bass growling note, took me so by surprise that I stared at
her open-mouthed.

"This gentleman has brought me news of my father, aunt," replied Kate
tremulously. "He's afraid, I'm afraid, that father has been made a
prisoner by blackmailers, and that he won't be released until money has
been paid for ransom."

"How absurd!" said the other lady, and in spite of the seriousness of
the situation, it was as much as I could do to refrain from laughing,
so irresistibly, so ludicrously, did her voice remind me of Mr. Penley
in _Charley's Aunt_.

Then, like a bell which pauses for a moment between its chimes, she
boomed again, "How very absurd!"

Miss Carleton turned appealingly to me. "Will you please tell my aunt
what you have just told me?" she said.

Haltingly and half-heartedly I repeated my story, the elder lady
pursing up her fleshy lips, rolling her eyes, and indulging in
long-drawn sniffs, so plainly indicating an incredulity which was lost
in admiration and wonder at its own magnificent power of control, that
I bungled the thing sadly, and was not surprised when, at the end of
the narrative, she rose majestically from her chair, and rang a rich
peal of warning and command.

"Clara, leave the room. I will join you, shortly."

She spoke as before, on one note, until she came to the last few words,
when her voice suddenly dropped an entire octave, and then sank in
rumbling silence, by falling, first one, and then another, note. This,
I found, was her invariable way of speaking. In effect, it reminded me
of a person walking with even step along a corridor, until he reaches
a flight of stairs, down eight of which he suddenly falls, at one
flight, recovering himself sufficiently, at the ninth, to rise and
stalk majestically down the last two or three.

If, in the course of my story, I do not again allude to this
peculiarity, it will not be because she ever lost the mannerism
in question, but because, the mannerism having already been fully
described, a repeated description of it in detail would, I fear, soon
become wearisome. It is so much easier, so much cheaper, if I may use
the word, to caricature a mannerism than to indicate character--to
describe a personal eccentricity than to indicate a type--that I am not
a little shamefaced at having written at such length regarding this
peculiarity of one of my characters. So marked a feature could not,
however, be passed over in silence, for I do not recall one solitary
occasion when she failed to drop her voice in the way I have described
when coming to the end of what she had to say.

Miss Carleton gone, her aunt, regarding me majestically, rang the bell.
When the man-servant appeared, she pointed at me.

"I wish to confer with my niece, Metcalfe. Meanwhile, that person must
not leave the house or this room. If he attempts to do so, call up the
other men-servants, and secure him."

With a warning glance at Metcalfe, and a glare at me, the good lady
left the room.

She was away about twenty minutes. On returning she dismissed the
servant, and seating herself, wheeled round in her chair, to turn all
her batteries upon my unhappy self. Her voice was, I fancied, a shade
less stately, a shade sharper, a shade brisker, and more business-like:

"What's your little game?"



JOHN CARLETON'S BURGLAR ALARM.


I stared at her blankly.

"Game?" I said. "Game? I haven't any game. You've heard my story. It's
the truth. I haven't anything else to tell or any game to play. What do
you take me for?"

"Rats!" she answered, shortly.

Then she strode over to a side table upon which lay a square box with a
button, like that of an electric bell.

"Have you ever seen one of these?" she inquired, pointing at it. "It
is my brother's own invention, and he is thinking of patenting it.
When this button is pressed (there's one of the machines in each
room), every door leading out of the house, and every window (they
are all of plate glass) by which it would be possible to escape, is
simultaneously and automatically locked; a burglar alarm is set ringing
in the kitchen, in the hall, and in all the men-servants' rooms, as
well as in the stables; and by a particularly ingenious arrangement, of
which my brother is especially proud, communication is also established
with the nearest police station. Once inside the house, no thief, or
burglar, if this button is pressed and the machinery is set going, can
hope to escape, for he is as neatly trapped as any rat.

"Well, young man (I haven't been told your name), since it has leaked
out that my brother is a millionaire and a philanthropist, every known
dodge in the begging-letter line and in the blackmailing line has been
tried on us; but, for sheer brazenry, I must say that your tale beats
all. My niece believes in you--more fool she!--but I'll tell you what I
think: every word that you have told us--except, perhaps, the fact of
my brother having been kidnapped by this man you call the Dumpling--is
an entire concoction; and if he really has been kidnapped as you say,
why, you are clearly the kidnapper's accomplice, and have come here to
sound us, and to pave the way for the abominable blackmailing which you
call holding to ransom. If any further proof of your confederacy with
the blackmailer is needed, that proof is supplied by the facts which
my niece has just made known to me. She tells me that only yesterday
morning, when she and I were at my brother's country house, she found
that someone had rowed out to the centre of the lake in our boat, and,
supposing it was I who was in the boat and that I had fallen asleep,
she swam out and found you in it. You were there, of course, in your
capacity of spy and shadower to your employer, and in order to acquaint
yourself with my brother's movements. It's a pity she didn't leave you
to be drowned--not that you'll be that, for I clearly foresee another
fate in store for you, and a less pleasant one. And now, if you please,
I propose sending for the police. I wonder if they'll believe your
story."

"No," I said smilingly, "they won't. I can tell you that before you
send, if it will be saving you any trouble."

"Ho! ho!" she said, triumphantly. "So you admit that I'm one too many
for you. You're not such a fool as I thought. Anyhow, you're 'cute
enough to know when you're dealing with a clever woman. It's wise of
you. If you had persisted in brazening me out with that preposterous
tale, you'd have been clapped between four walls this very night. I
mean what I say. But I'm not a hard-hearted woman, and, by the look of
you, you ought to be a cut above being the accomplice of criminals and
blackmailers."

After a pause, during which she regarded me with a stern but not
altogether unfriendly eye, the good lady spoke again, this time almost
pityingly:

"An accomplice of criminals and blackmailers! What brought you to it,
young man? Drink--debt--gambling--or worse? Come, now, I don't want to
be hard upon you. Make a clean breast of it, and I'll do what I can
to help you back to an honest life. You have already confessed the
falsehood of your story, and if----"

"I have done nothing of the sort," I interrupted indignantly. "My story
is perfectly true--every word of it; and if you'll let me----"

"Your story perfectly true!" she thundered. "Why, you told me just now,
with your own mouth, when I was going to send for the police--and that
reminds me: I'll ring the bell and send for them now--that you knew
they wouldn't believe it. If you're not the----"

"I know they won't believe it, because I've already told them," I cut
in. "I see a telephone bell in the corner there. Ring up Inspector
S----, of New Scotland Yard, or the Superintendent at ---- Station,
and ask them whether I haven't already been to them with the identical
story. They don't believe me now, because they don't want to; but when
the inquest is held and the facts come out, they'll find, and you'll
find, that every word I have said is perfectly true. Or," I added--for
she had actually rung the bell when threatening to send for the police,
and the servant had come to the door in response--"or send out and buy
an evening paper. You'll find the fact of the finding of the three
bodies off Canvey Island, just as I have told you."

"You can go, Metcalfe," she said to the waiting servant. "I shan't want
you at present."

Then she turned to me again.

"I don't know what to do," she said undecidedly. "If I let you go, and
your story turns out to be a lie, you'll have decamped of course when
you're wanted. If I hand you over to the police, you'll be in safe
keeping and----"

"It will mean a night in gaol, if you give me in charge at this hour,"
I interrupted, "in which case I shall certainly bring an action against
you for false imprisonment."

"Yes," she said meditatively, walking over to a side-table and turning
over some books as she spoke. "Yes, I suppose you would; and if your
story is true I'm not sure that I should blame you if you did, for no
one likes to be imprisoned when they've only told the truth. For the
matter of that, I don't know that I shouldn't dislike the publicity
of an action for false imprisonment more than you'd dislike the
imprisonment; and my brother--there's no escape from _that_ fact--would
be furious with me for getting my name and his into the papers. I
didn't believe a word of your story when I first heard it, but looking
at you more closely, I must say that you don't look or talk like a
liar, and I've a good mind to follow my instincts and trust you, after
all."

The magnanimity of this sudden outburst of confidence in my integrity
was somewhat lessened by the fact that, while affecting to turn over
some books on the side-table, she had all the time been scanning an
evening newspaper which lay neatly folded on the top of a pile of
books. I had purchased a copy of the same journal earlier in the
evening, and was well aware that a paragraph, describing the finding
of the three bodies, was printed in large type at the top of the first
page. Folded as the paper was, this paragraph was the most prominent
item of news, and could scarcely fail to catch even a cursory eye.

Possibly the reading of the paragraph sufficiently confirmed my story
to assist her to a decision.

"Come here, young man. I want to have a look at you," she said
peremptorily, walking over to the light.

I obeyed, and for half a minute was subjected to the scrutiny of her
keen but not unkindly eyes.

"That'll do!" she said, pushing me away testily. "I'm going to make a
fool of myself; but anyhow, I'm going to trust you, fool or no fool.
And now tell me what it is you want."

Some instinct told me that she was a woman to gain whose confidence
one must give one's confidence. Looking her full in the face I made
answer boldly:

"I want to marry your niece."



THE FACE AT THE BROKEN WINDOW.


Miss Clara sat down--perhaps I should say collapsed down. But for the
fact that a huge Chesterfield stood immediately at her back, ready to
receive the fair burden of her charms, I am persuaded that her ultimate
destination would have been the floor. The suddenness of my statement
"dropped" her as neatly as a good marksman "drops" his bird.

Sinking--"all of a flutter," as she afterwards described it, thus
unconsciously confirming the aptness of my bird imagery--upon the
Chesterfield, this truly remarkable woman merely observed, "Well, I
never!" and then as speedily recovering herself, sat up and said,
quietly:

"I knew there was something behind it all along."

This was said, I may observe, not in relation to the Chesterfield which
had so fortunately been behind _her_, but to my story.

"Of course you did," I said. "Anyone could see that with half an eye.
There are two things behind it. First, I want you to help me to marry
your niece, and second, I want to help you to get your brother out of
the hands of these blackmailers."

In thus coupling our common interests, and in thus bespeaking, if not
assuming, her assistance on my behalf, I was taking a good deal for
granted, but she did not seem to resent it.

"You have plenty of impudence, young man," she said, smiling grimly.
"You'll be wanting someone to help you to marry me next."

"That," I answered, "is the one regret I shall have, if I succeed in
winning your niece. It will prevent me from ever hoping to win the
heart and hand (and what a pretty hand it is too!) of her charming and
accomplished aunt."

Then I told of my well-deserved ducking in the lake, admitting frankly
that I had lied when I had said I could not swim, but pleading my cause
and the excuses to be urged in my favour with all the eloquence at my
command, and, judging by her increasing friendliness, not altogether
without success.

"And now," I said, when I had made an end of it, "now about your
brother and the kidnapping?"

"Yes," she replied, "we have to think of that. I expect you think that
both Kate and I have taken it coolly, considering. But, you see, you
don't know my brother. If you did, you'd have very little fear about
his being able to take care of himself, wherever he is. What do you
propose?"

"First of all," I said, "I'll ask you to ascertain whether the house is
still being watched. You are taking me very much on trust, and if it
should turn out that the shadower has returned to his post, or another
shadower has been put on duty, it will go a little way to confirm my
story, and to prove that I'm not altogether an impostor."

"I either trust people altogether, or don't trust them at all," she
answered. "But you've been frank with me, so I'll tell you now that I
haven't taken you so entirely upon trust as you imagine. There's an
evening paper on that table which has an account of the finding of the
bodies, just as you mentioned; and when I went upstairs to speak to my
niece, I took the opportunity to peep up and down the road from behind
the blinds. There _is_ a man watching this house, and also a house
somewhere in Taunton Square, just as you said. It certainly is very
curious. Come in!"

The last two words were spoken in response to a knock. The door, when
opened, revealed Metcalfe with a telegram on a salver. She read the
slip of orange paper quite coolly, and then passed it to me, saying,
"From my brother."

It was as follows:--

 Hope Kate and you not anxious last night. Letter I wrote early
 yesterday morning explaining was called to Glasgow on business not
 posted by oversight. Only just discovered it in my pocket. So sorry.
 May be away some days.--JOHN.

"So, you see, he's safe enough," Miss Clara said, smiling. "Do you
really think you're right in thinking he is one of the millionaires
they want to kidnap? I admit it is a curious coincidence that someone
should be watching the house."

"Perhaps I _have_ jumped to conclusions somewhat," I said. "But
if someone is really watching the house again, I ought to be at
work, not wasting any more of your time and my time by gossiping
here--especially as it turns out after all that Mr. Carleton is safe.
If there is any back door I could slip out by, I think I'll either
follow the shadower myself, and see if I can't find out where he comes
from, or perhaps even try to get New Scotland Yard to arrest him on
suspicion. He's the only clue I've got to the whereabouts of the
Dumpling, and it won't do for me to lose sight of him. What's that
noise, I wonder, in the street? There's something amiss, clearly. It
won't do for me to be seen leaving the house. Would you mind letting
your servant inquire?"

"Certainly, if you wish it," she said, ringing the bell.

"Metcalfe, just find out what that disturbance in the street is," she
said, when the man appeared, "and come back to report to me."

"I have been out to see already, m'm," Metcalfe answered respectfully.
"A man's been stabbed--killed, too. They say he's a brother of Mr.
Grant the detective, who lives at No. 10, Taunton Place, and very like
him, and that a man who has been hanging about the street all day
stabbed him just as he was coming out of No. 10. Why he did it nobody
knows, unless the murderer's a criminal that Mr. Grant was after, and
stabbed the brother, thinking it was the detective himself. And the
worst of it is he's got away, too! But what's that?"

From the back of the house there came a sound that was suspiciously
like the stealthy breaking of glass.

It so happens that I have extraordinary sharp hearing, and was able
with some exactness to locate the direction whence the sound came.

Calling out "Follow me, Metcalfe!" I dashed down the stairs and through
a door which led to a corridor, at the end of which was a conservatory.
A cold wind indicated either an open door or window--perhaps a broken
window. As I raced along the corridor--the bewildered Metcalfe so far
behind me that I could hear his heavy steps descending the stairs--I
saw that though all the other plants in the conservatory were perfectly
still, one white-blossomed flower in a pot was swaying and moving as if
in a draught, and the next moment there peered, through a broken pane
of glass behind it, the white and wicked face of the Dumpling.



MISS CLARA "SAVES MY LIFE."


One arm was stretched through the broken window towards the
conservatory door, which he was trying to unlock; but seeing that
someone was approaching he withdrew his arm hurriedly, and the white
face that had been peering through the jagged hole in the window-pane
disappeared. The next instant I was at the conservatory door, all agog
to unfasten it and to give chase, when suddenly, from every part of the
building, came the ringing of alarm bells, and, with a sharp click, a
bolt upon the conservatory door slid into its place. Clearly Miss Clara
had pressed the button of the burglar alarm, thus locking the very
door to which my hand was then stretched, and so effectually shutting
me in, and a possible housebreaker out. With one twist of my fist I
turned the key to which the Dumpling had been directing his attention.
Then I tried to slide back the only remaining fastening--the bolt which
had been shot into its place by the burglar alarm. It held fast,
and cursing Miss Clara, her inventful brother, and his too ingenious
burglar box, I tugged at the door with all my strength, but to no
purpose. The thing would not budge an inch, and when I snatched up a
piece of rockwork from a fernery and bashed desperately at the hateful
bolt, I only made matters worse. So far from loosening, the bolt
seemed only to set its teeth, bulldogwise, the more tenaciously for my
blows. Grinning with rage, and with the strain of concentrating all
the strength of my body into my two fists, I threw down the rockwork,
with a word I hesitate to repeat, but which Metcalfe, upon whose foot
the piece of rockwork fell, had no hesitation in forcibly repeating,
what time he limped upon one leg around the conservatory with a grin
of pain upon his face more beautiful to behold than the grin which had
so recently been upon mine. For the present it was clear that, thanks
to Miss Clara and the invention of her resourceful brother, the quarry
had escaped me. Long before I could have knocked out sufficient glass
to crawl through the conservatory window, long before Miss Clara could
have reversed the action of the machine and so released the lock upon
the door, the Dumpling would be far away.



Under the circumstances I thought it wise to put the best face I could
upon my defeat, delicately hinting at the same time to Metcalfe that I
should be personally obliged if he would make it convenient to do the
same upon his pain, since much as one might admire a stone gargoyle
which bore a resemblance to a human face, a human face which bore a
striking likeness to a stone gargoyle in pain was less admirable and
more alarming.

"And now," I said, "we'll return to the drawing-room and to Miss Clara,
and get her to open the conservatory door so that we can search the
garden without delay."

The returning to the drawing-room was easier to speak of than
to accomplish, for the door, leading into the corridor from the
conservatory, had been securely locked by the same fell agency which
had so effectually interfered to prevent my giving chase to the
Dumpling; and it was some time before I could persuade the parties,
on the other side, that the persons clamouring for entrance were not
burglars or murderers, but only Metcalfe and myself.

After a word or two to Miss Clara, I returned, accompanied by Metcalfe,
to the conservatory, and thence to the garden. As I had feared, all
was to no purpose. The broken window-pane was the only evidence of
our recent visitor, for though we scoured the place from end to end,
we could not find as much as a footprint by way of a clue. Without a
warrant from the police--which I had no possibility of obtaining--I
could not hope to explore the neighbouring garden, where it was
possible the Dumpling might still be concealed; so we returned,
somewhat chapfallen, to the house. Miss Clara, who was awaiting us with
a perturbed countenance, refused to share my dissatisfaction at the
result which had been brought about by her ill-timed action in setting
the burglar alarm at work.

"In all probability I saved your life," she said calmly. "A man like
that, who had just committed a murder, and no doubt had come here to
commit another, or to burgle the house, was tolerably sure to have been
armed; and if you had been able to open the conservatory door and to
follow him out, he would in all probability have shot you at sight."

"I thought you said that all the windows were plate glass," I grumbled.
"If so, how did the man contrive to break that pane and to get an arm
through?"

"I said all the windows in the house," corrected Miss Clara. "The
conservatory isn't in the house, and no one could get into the house,
from the conservatory, without passing through the corridor door,
which, as you know, was fast locked, like the rest of the doors and the
windows, when I pressed the burglar bell.

"Well, you have done your best, Mr. Rissler. No man can do more. We
shall have the police here directly. They have been a long time in
coming as it is, but I expect the entire staff is out hunting for the
murderer of poor young Grant. What shall we do when they come?"

"Tell them the facts, of course," I said, "and let them see the broken
window-pane and examine the garden for themselves. If I hadn't supposed
they were already on the way here, and if I hadn't been in such a hurry
to get out and search the garden, as not to give myself a moment to
think, I should have urged upon you the necessity of sending for them
before. Hush! Was that a ring at the front door? I think so. Very
possibly it is they."

It was--a sergeant and an ordinary constable, decent fellows, honest
fellows, conscientious fellows, both of them, but not, I imagine,
overburdened either of them with brains. Plainly they did not associate
the attempt to enter the house with the murder. The impression they
gave was that they thought a mere alarm of burglary very small beer
when compared with an actual murder. Miss Clara told them that while
she and I were talking, we heard the sound of falling glass below,
that I had gone down and had seen a man's face at a broken window. She
explained the circumstances which prevented me from following him, and
added that I believed the face to be that of a man respecting whom I
had laid information at Scotland Yard that very morning.

The sergeant and the constable listened to Miss Clara's statement
without excitement, and when she had made an end of it expressed a
wish to see the conservatory, the broken window and the garden, made
a few notes, took my name and address, accepted readily the glass of
whisky and water which Miss Clara suggested, but declined with equal
readiness the half-crown which the same lady, by way of compensation
for the trouble to which she had put them, endeavoured to press into
their hands, and remarking that they had done no more than their duty,
wished us good-night and so departed.

Then I turned to my hostess and unfolded my own plans.

"To tell the honest truth, Miss Carleton," I said, "I was not at all
anxious to be mixed up in this new development. I shall have more than
enough advertisement at the inquest, which is to be held to-morrow, on
the three bodies found off Canvey, and if I am called as a witness at
the inquest which will have to be held on the body of young Grant--the
police and the public will begin to think my connection with both
murders somewhat suspicious. If I were to have followed my inclinations
I should have pretended that I was anxious to learn more of the
circumstances of young Grant's murder, and should have asked you to let
me slip out to see if I could pick up any news, so as to be out of the
way when the police called. But a murder, a brutal murder, has been
committed, and though I am still smarting from the undeserved snubbing
I received when I called at Scotland Yard this morning, I should feel
that I was behaving not only like a bad citizen, but as little less
than a criminal, were I to keep back anything which would assist the
police in their search. And now, may I get on to something else which
I very much wish to say? The fact that the face I saw at the broken
window was that of the Dumpling, is to me very significant. It is, you
must admit, a strong confirmation of the theories I have formed, and of
which I have already told you. Why did I watch Grant's house? Because
if the Dumpling believed Grant to be alive, I was tolerably sure he
would lose no time in putting Grant out of the way. What was the result
of my watching? This--that I found someone was watching Grant's house,
and not only Grant's house, but this house as well. Then came the
question, Why was he watching this house? I knew from Parker that the
Dumpling had planned to kidnap certain millionaires, and to hold them
to ransom. Hearing on inquiry that your brother was a millionaire, I
thought it not unlikely that it was he who was to have been kidnapped
last night. I think so still, but I am inclined to believe that my
appearance at the opium den upset the calculations of the conspirators,
and so prevented them from carrying out their plans. They are still
watching this house, however. Why? Because they are waiting for your
brother's return so that they may learn his movements, and lay their
plans accordingly.

"Then came the murder of young Grant. It may have been, or it may not
have been, the work of the Dumpling and his accomplices. Personally, I
haven't a moment's doubt that it was so. While all the neighbourhood is
hunting for the murderer, a man tries to remove a pane of glass in your
conservatory. Who is this man? Is he a burglar who, with no connection
whatever with the murder, has chanced to choose this particular night
to break into your house? I don't think so. He could hardly have
failed to hear that a murder had just been committed in your immediate
neighbourhood, and if so, would he be fool enough to select the very
night when he knows the police will be wide awake and on the watch?
Not likely. If he had been an ordinary burglar, he would have had his
diamond with him, and would have cut out, not broken, that pane of
glass. The man who broke the glass was a fugitive, and in desperate
straits.

"Possibly he thought that at this hour of the night no one would be
likely to come into the conservatory, and that he could lie in hiding
till the hue and cry had passed. Possibly he hoped to slip through the
house unobserved, and so make his way into the street from the front,
in order to disarm suspicion. A man who had just committed a murder was
not likely to walk boldly out of the front door of such a house as this.

"But why did the Dumpling hit upon this particular house? Was it by
chance, and because it was the first which came handy when he managed
to evade his pursuers by scaling a wall and lying in hiding, while they
went by? I don't think so. That he did escape by scaling a wall I have
very little doubt; but I believe that he made his way to the house
deliberately, and with set intention. It is quite clear to me that he
has designs of some sort upon this house or upon its master. Even if
the design were no more than a burglary, you may be tolerably sure that
so clever a criminal as he doesn't attempt to burgle a house without
first acquainting himself with the position of the different rooms,
and all the difficulties which would be presented in getting in and in
getting out. My belief is that the Dumpling chose this house for his
hiding-place deliberately. Upon this house, for some reason of his own,
he is keeping a watch, and it is from this house that I must set my
counter-watch for him. I have a strange presentiment that it will not
be long before we shall see him here again. Someone--something--there
is in this house upon whom, or upon which, he has designs. It may be
its master; it may be only its master's money. To-night, if you will be
so good, so very good, Miss Carleton, as to trust me thus far, I want
to conceal myself in the garden. If nothing comes of it, no harm is
done. If any attempt is made to enter, I shall be there to frustrate it
and to give the alarm. You perhaps think my request a strange as well
as a foolish one. But listen. Whether the man, looking in at the broken
window-pane of the conservatory, recognised me--whether he even saw
me at all, I do not know. But I saw him, and for one second's space,
before the white face of him disappeared, I not only saw him, but
looked him full in the eyes. And in that second I saw something else.
As in a dream-tableau, I saw that same man creeping stealthily, and at
the darkest, deadest hour of the night, towards the same window, and
through the same garden."



MY FRIEND THE DUMPLING.


Romantic, Miss Clara may or may not have been; superstitious she
certainly was not. For some reason of her own she had formed a not
unflattering opinion of my intelligence--an opinion which, I fear, my
reference to these dream-tableaux did not a little to shake. And when
Miss Clara thought poorly of a person or of a thing, she said so with a
directness which was somewhat disconcerting. Her comment on the words
with which I closed my last chapter was:

"Mr. Rissler, don't be a fool!"

"I try not," I said lamely. "What's the particular folly of mine you
have in mind at the present moment?"

"Why, this dream-tableau business, of course," she answered. "You're no
fool--quite the contrary--in most respects; but I've no patience with
this nonsense about dream men kneeling on your chest in a dream garden.
If you've got anything on your chest, you should look after your
digestion--not talk about your dreams. And that reminds me. I generally
take a glass of hot milk and a biscuit before going to bed. If you are
going to sit up out of doors all night in the garden, as you propose,
you'll want something more substantial. Oblige me by ringing that bell.
I suppose you smoke," she said, when I had made a substantial supper.
"If so, you may. My brother's a great smoker, so you need have no
scruples.

"What I like about you," she continued, when I had lit up in accordance
with her permission, "is that you're a young man who can make up his
mind. To tell me, within the first half-hour you'd ever seen me, that
you wanted to marry my niece when you'd only seen her once before, was
about as brazen a piece of impudence as I've ever heard of. But I'd
rather a man should be that sort than one of your 'Oh, I'm sure I don't
mind which' and 'I haven't any choice in the matter' kind of person."

"I count myself fortunate in the possession of your good opinion, Miss
Carleton," I said with a bow.

"None of your blarney!" she answered gruffly. "Not that I mind a person
being pleasant-spoken and pleasant-mannered," she added, "although
Heaven knows I'm rough enough in ways and in speech myself. There's
something waiting on the tip of your tongue to say. What is it?"

"There is, but your penetration alarms me," I said. "It was merely to
wonder whether I might venture to inquire where your niece has been all
this while, and during all these disturbing events?"

"You may. She's in her own room. I told her to stay there till I called
her down. I sent up word to her not to be alarmed, before I rang
the burglar bell. That's why it didn't go off before you got to the
conservatory door. If I'd rung when you left the room as I should have
done except for alarming Clara, you would not have got further than the
corridor door."

"That was very dear and considerate and thoughtful of you," I replied.
"I'm going to be very fond of you, if you'll let me, before I've done,
Miss Carleton."

"Done what?" she asked grimly, but not ill-pleased.

"This cigar," I replied promptly. "I suppose you thought I was going
to say before I'm your nephew-in-law; but, hasten that happy day
as I would--and it cannot come too soon for me--it would seem an
interminable long time to wait, if I had to put off being fond of you
till then. I suppose I shan't be seeing Miss Kate again to-night."

"You'll not!" she answered bluntly. "And if you call her Kate instead
of Clara, you'll not be seeing her at all, if I have anything to do
with it, for call people out of their right names, no one shall, while
I can help it."

The logic of a lady who, in spite of the fact that she persistently
called her own niece out of the name which had been given the girl at
her christening, the name by which everyone else, from her own father
downwards, habitually called her, yet could thus lay down the law, was
too fearful a thing for a mere male to contemplate, so I smiled weakly,
and said, "I beg your pardon! 'Miss Clara,' I meant, of course. How
silly of me!"

Incidentally I made a note in my memory to the effect that the best way
out of the dilemma would be, when speaking of my Lady of the Lake, to
refer to her as "your niece," or as "Miss Carleton."

"No," said Miss Clara, philosophically, and with the air of one who,
not expecting too much from fallen human nature, is always ready to be
tolerant, and to make allowance; "no, I don't say, and I don't see,
that it is silly of you. That is too severe a word, and the mistake is
not unnatural on your part, when you remember that her own father made
it twenty years ago, and has gone on doing it ever since."

As she spoke the clock struck eleven.

"Is it so late?" I said. "I had no idea. Now, with your permission,
Miss Carleton, I'll be off to the garden. I shall never forget your
goodness to me to-night--taking me on trust, as you have, when
everything was against me, and making me feel, now that I am about to
say good-night, as if I were saying it, not to one who an hour or so
ago was a complete stranger to me, but to a dear and kind and generous
friend. How shall I ever thank you?"

"Don't try," she said laconically, rising. "Good-night."

I sprang to open the door for her, stooping low to raise to my lips the
surprisingly small and white and well-formed hand which she extended to
me.

"And now," I said to myself, when she had gone, "now for my vigil
in the garden. In my dream picture only a night ago, I saw myself
lying on my back, the man I am seeking kneeling over me, knife in
hand. The place where this happened I could not see. But to-night,
in another dream picture, I saw the same man crouched low to steal
by dead of night through a garden. I wonder whether that garden and
the place of my first dream are one and the same? I wonder whether
it was good fortune or an evil fate which guided my feet to the
opium den yesterday, and brought me and that same man to this house
to-night? I wonder whether he or I have met and striven in this or in
some pre-existent world? I wonder why it is that only when looking in
his eyes do I see these pictures which come and go so strangely in
my brain? But most of all, I wonder whether I might venture to ring
the bell, and ask the gentle Metcalfe to bring me a drink. All this
'wondering' and this 'whethering' makes me feel not only uncommonly
dry, but also more like the hero who never was on sea or land except in
the pages of a shilling shocker, or in a melodramatic play, than like
an ordinary, everyday young man who fancies that a pipeful of tobacco
taken in conjunction with liquid refreshment in the shape of a stiff
'whisky,' would suit his complaint down to the ground. Anyhow, I'll
try. Then for the garden, for my dream picture, and possibly for our
friend and enemy, the Dumpling!"



THE GHOST IN THE GARDEN.


The place selected in which to keep my watch had, I imagine, been
intended by the builder for a coal-cellar; but from the fact that the
walls of thick cement were set around with shelves, partitioned into
squares, I concluded that some subsequent tenant had seen fit to turn
it into a wine-cellar. One entered from the garden, and passing down
a few stone steps, came to a wooden door like that of a coal-cellar
or tool-house, opening upon a short passage, the walls of which were
evenly cemented. At the end of this passage another door--of iron this
time, and fitted with a patent lock--had been added; and, as it did
not seem likely that anyone would trouble to protect garden tools or
coals by the addition of an extra door, such as one sees in a strong
room or on a safe, the presumption was, as I say, that the place had
been intended for the storage or the laying down of wine. But whatever
its purpose, it made a serviceable sentry-box, for by leaving the two
doors open I could command a view of the garden. Seeing by the light of
a vesta, which I struck on entering, that a naked gas-jet was fixed to
the wall, and finding that the gas was laid on, I lit it for a moment
or two while I had time to look round. Had I chosen to keep the inner
door shut, I could have left the light burning all night, and with no
fear of its gleam being seen from outside. But in that case I could not
have kept the necessary eye upon the garden; so, after I had turned an
empty champagne case into a somewhat uneasy and uncomfortable seat, I
put out the light, and, opening both doors wide, sat down to commence
my watch.

       *       *       *       *       *

One!

Two!

Three!

"Three o'clock and a wet night!" I said to myself, yawning wearily.
"The policeman, whom I've just heard pass, isn't likely to get wet
feet, judging by the thickness of the boots he's wearing. I wonder how
he manages to walk like that? One might think he did it purposely, to
warn the gentle burglar to lie low while law-and-order is passing.
First of all comes his heel with a _flick_, and then the flat of his
foot with a _flack_, like the double beat of a flail. _Flick-flack,
flick-flack, flick-flack!_

"But perhaps I'm blaming the poor man without a cause. It may be that
it is only because we hear the policeman's tramp, sounding and echoing
on an empty pavement, that we think it peculiar; and possibly my own
footfalls could as readily be recognised were they heard at night, when
other sounds are still.

"Now he's stopped. Trying a door or window perhaps. Now he's on the
move again. _Flick-flack, flick-flack, flick-flack!_ It seems to me
that, listening here as I am, I could locate his whereabouts all down
the street. All down the street, did I say? Yes, and down the next
street, and the street after that, if one wished to do so. I'm sure I
don't. All I want now is to see this thing through, and to get home to
a cold bath and a bed. And it won't be long now, for very likely that
is Robert's last beat down this way for the night--or, rather, for the
morning.

"Was that something stirring at the end of the garden? Another cat,
I expect. How that other brute made me jump--creeping in upon me so
stealthily that I didn't know it was there, till I saw its horrible
eyes, glaring at me like a ghost out of the dark!

"Here's another yawn coming. Y-a-a-a-a-ow!

"There's another yawn gone, and I seem to see quite a procession of
yawns looming up before me. What a queer place it is--this thread of
territory, which I call 'Half-Awake-Land'! It's a sort of boundary
line--no more--between Dream-Land and Waking-Land, and as one can't
stand on a boundary line, any more than one can stand on a stretched
thread, I keep tumbling in and out, first into Dream-Land and then into
Waking-Land all the time. One of the funny things about Half-Awake-Land
is that all one's thoughts turn into pictures.

"When I yawned a few minutes ago, I said to myself that I saw 'quite
a procession of yawns looming up before me,' and then, as I say, my
thoughts turned into pictures, and the earth, as far as ever I could
see, seemed to have as many cracks or crevasses in it as a newly
ploughed field has furrows. As I looked each crack yawned open, like
the huge mouth of some rude person who gapes in your face, without
having the decency even to gape behind his hand, so that the world
seemed to wrinkle away to the horizon's edge in a thousand opened
mouths.

"Then all of a sudden I saw a great Sleep-Sea in front of me. All the
waves upon it were yawns, and they came rolling in upon me, one after
the other, till I feared I was going to be carried off my feet by a
bigger yawn than any of the others, and so washed away and drowned.

"What a farrago of nonsense, half-soliloquy, half sleep-talking, I've
been thinking or speaking--I hardly know which. Hullo! Nodding again!
This won't do! If it hadn't been that I'm sitting up, instead of lying
down, I should have dropped right off to sleep that time. I was nearly
off my seat, as it was. It was the forward lurching of my head and body
which woke me, and the jerk seemed sharp enough to snap one's backbone
at the neck, not to speak of making one's heart jump inside one, like a
frightened frog. What tricks one's brain plays in a moment's snatched
sleep! Three seconds ago I was awake and talking about one's thoughts
turning into pictures when one is half-awake and half-asleep. After
that I reminded myself that I must keep awake, lest the Dumpling should
steal in upon me unawares. Then I suppose that for a second's space I
dropped off; and again the thought turned into a picture in my brain.
I was sitting, just as I am now, looking at the incandescent burner of
that lamp-post in the side street to the right of the garden. And that
reminds me. It's a strong light, and if I don't get a little farther
back it is just possible that I might be seen by anybody who looked
over the wall at the garden's end. That's better! No one could see me
here; I'm well in the shadow. Yes, I was sitting here, blinking, as I
say, at the incandescent light on the lamp-post, and as I sat I saw
a black object, like the crouched figure of a man, creeping along in
the shadow of the wall. It was the over-wrought brain playing tricks
again--projecting out of itself the picture of the person of whom one
had been thinking, so that one could easily believe that what one saw
was the actual flesh-and-blood person himself. I'm morally sure I shall
fall asleep in dead earnest if I sit here any longer. I think I'll
steal outside for a moment or two, if only to stretch my legs, and to
shake off the drowsiness which is coming over me."

Very lightly and on tip-toe I crept out--to receive a sudden,
sickening, crushing blow, which brought me blinded, and with the blood
running down into my eyes and mouth, to my knees.



THE MAN WITH GORILLA ARMS.


The only wonder is that I wasn't killed outright, as would have
happened had my antagonist been as tall as I. But enormously strong
as the Dumpling was, my superior height saved my life. He had struck
at me with a life-preserver heavily loaded with lead, but being many
inches less in stature than I, he had struck short. Hence the blow
which, had it taken me directly on the head, as intended, would have
made a very batter-pudding of my brains, did no more than inflict
a nasty skin-wound, more of a graze than a gash, above one temple.
Even had the blow fallen directly on my shoulder, I should in all
probability have been disabled for the rest of my life. Luckily for
me, however, the loaded life-preserver barely scraped, instead of
smashing, my shoulder-blade, and though for the moment I fell--dazed
and blinded by my own blood--to my knees, my hurts were by no means
serious. As I lay, half stupefied by the suddenness of the attack and
by the blow, yet not too stupefied to forget to shield my head, lest
my antagonist should strike again, I was seized around the waist, by
arms so abnormally long and strong that they were more like those of
a gorilla than of a man, and was carried swiftly to the cellar. To
say that unconsciously I feigned unconsciousness may seem a queer way
of describing what followed; but it is a fact that I lay, apparently
as lifeless, on the cellar floor, as if I had been a spider, shamming
death in the presence of an enemy. And this I did automatically as far
as I can remember, without knowing why I did it.

"I hope he isn't dead, poor devil!" said the Dumpling aloud, to
himself, and in a tone of voice which, in view of the fact that my
death was the fact he had a few moments before had in view, and had,
indeed, done his best to compass, struck me as unnecessarily anxious.
His methods reminded me somewhat of modern warfare, in which we first
do everything in our power to put a bullet into a man, by means of a
gun, and then do everything in our power, by means of good surgery, to
get it out. It always seems to me that--since once we have wounded
a man, our chief anxiety is to restore the _status quo_ by healing
his wound--the desired end might be attained, and the _status quo_
established, by means considerably less expensive to ourselves and
undoubtedly less painful to him.

"I hope he isn't dead," muttered the Dumpling again, laying me down
with surprising gentleness. "It's one of the servants, I suppose, who
has been ordered to be on watch all night in case there's a second
attempt to break into the house, and I have no quarrel with _him_."

As he spoke I suddenly seized him by the legs and toppled him over,
fastening on him like a bulldog the instant he was down. From the first
it was clear that I was wholly outmatched, and had no chance. I had him
on his back, one knee on his chest, and my hands at his throat; but he
put up his two hands very much in the same indifferent way in which
he would have gone to work to fasten--or to unfasten--a collar-stud,
and taking my two wrists, one in each of his fists, he forced them
apart, and away from his neck, as easily as a clamp or a vice opens or
shuts by the twisting of the screw. As if to show his strength, he
held my two hands powerless, thus, for a few seconds, and then with a
contemptuous laugh he swung me away from him and aside, as easily as
a man, who is teaching a child to jump, swings the little one from a
chair to the floor.

What followed I have never ceased to regret. The man had had it in his
power, then and there, to strangle me as I lay. With an antagonist
whose arms were, as I have said, as long and as strong as a gorilla's,
and whose hands held one in a grip of iron, it was useless--athletic
and muscular as I am--to struggle. I was as a child in his grasp;
and, remembering that he had--whether from a contempt which was more
cruel than a blow, or from some instinct of chivalry which made him
disdainful of so puny an opponent--set me free of his own accord,
and, in a sense, thrown my liberty in my face, remembering all this,
I am ashamed to record what followed. The only point to be urged in
my excuse is that I was beside myself with wounded vanity and by the
humiliation which had been put upon me--I was about to have written by
the humiliation of my defeat; but defeat comes after a contest, and
between him and me there had been, thus far, as little appearance of
contest as there is when a strapping nursemaid takes a naughty child
across her knees, and, in spite of the culprit's tears and kicks,
administers the necessary number of smacks. Whether what I have urged,
in extenuation of what I did, will be accounted any excuse by the
reader, I cannot say; but the fact remains that, mad with impotent
anger, and burning for some sort of revenge, I rose to my feet and
struck him, unprepared as he was, full in the face, and with all my
might.

With a snarl like that of a wild beast he closed with me, and for a
few seconds--for my fury seemed temporarily to endow me with a giant's
strength--we rolled over and over, each striving to pin the other to
the ground.

Even at this distance of time, as I seek to recall that moment, I can
well believe that the bloody, bestial savagery of the fight--except for
the short, gasping, hissing intaking and expulsion of breath, we fought
in silence--might have turned a possible onlooker sick with loathing
and disgust. But it was soon over. The strain I had put upon myself,
when first grappling with him, was too terrific to last. My strength
suddenly failed me, and I fell backward, his fingers upon my throat.

In our struggle we had worked our way out of the cellar and into the
passage which led to the garden, and, as I went crashing backward,
I saw for one instant, by the light from the lamp-post in the side
street, that his right hand was already at his hip-pocket in search
of a knife. The next instant he was kneeling on my chest, the knife
upraised to strike--just as I had foreseen in the dream-tableau. As
he bent over me to get a yet firmer grip upon my throat, the yellow
lamp-light fell across my face. Out of his face, which had now turned
white and haggard, the blood-fury seemed suddenly to die.

"My God!" he gasped. "It's Grant the detective--and I've killed the
wrong man!"

Then there came into his eyes a look which, seeing it again in dreams
even now, years after, makes me awake with a cry, to find the cold
perspiration from my forehead running down into my eyes, my limbs
trembling and my heart leaping like a frightened creature.

"I've got you at last, Grant, have I!" he said, in a voice of cold
and slow and deadly calmness. "Just now--seeing him go in and out of
your house, and, striking in the dark, as I did--I killed a man whom I
believed to be you. But there can be no mistake this time. I've got you
now, and this time"--he took a firmer grip of the knife--"this time, I
rather guess you're going to die."



I PLAY THE CRAVEN.


Then I played the craven. It is useless to say any more. It is idle to
urge an excuse. I played the craven, and pleaded to the man at whom, a
few minutes before, when he was unprepared, and after he had spared my
life, I had struck a cowardly blow.

"Don't strike!" I gasped. "I'm not Grant--Grant is dead. I've seen his
body. I'll tell you about it, if you'll not strike."

"This," he said--almost drawled--in slow, deliberate accents, "is very
extraordinary and most interesting. I won't promise to spare your life.
But I'll hear your tale. I'll promise nothing else, young man, whoever
you are, till I've heard you out."

My momentary panic was over. Already I was beginning to feel ashamed of
myself. Already the manhood which had deserted me was returning.

"Stop a moment," I said. "I won't have my life on false pretences. I
lost my nerve just now and played the coward; but, please God, I'll
play the man again. I'm not Grant, it is true, and Grant is dead; but
I'm your enemy, and I meant and mean to hunt you down. So knife me now
if you want to, but before you do so, I'd like to ask your pardon for
striking you, after you'd spared my life, and when you were unprepared.
It was a cad's blow--a coward's blow--and I am ashamed of it."

I stopped short, red-faced and choking. He gave an uneasy, abrupt
laugh, and, rising, put back his knife.

"Get up!" he said; "I guess you mean playing the game fairly. As for
the bit of a blow, we'll say no more about it. Perhaps I deserved it.
It does not do to think an opponent's beaten and means throwing up the
sponge too early in the game. For what happens after I've heard your
story--whether I kill you, as kill you I assuredly can this moment and
in this place--I promise nothing till I've heard you out. This much,
however, I will say. You tell me you are my enemy, and that you meant
and still mean hunting me down. Well, that's straight talk, and I'll
say this much of straight talk to you in return. If you are my enemy
only, I wouldn't and couldn't kill you for any reason under the sun.
If you're the enemy of the cause I have at heart, I'd find you out and
kill you though all Scotland Yard itself acted as your bodyguard and
protector. That's the state of the market, young man. First of all,
let me ask you whether that yarn you spun in the opium den about your
having come there by chance as an author in search of copy was true?"

"Every word of it," I answered.

"Well, now, tell me what you have been doing since, and how you came
to be in this house, and in this garden. I have got to know, and it
will go better with you, if you tell me with your own lips, than if you
force me to find it out for myself, as I most assuredly shall. I don't
want to kill you. It is horrible to me to have to take a life--unless
the safety of the cause is concerned, and then I'd kill you or anyone
else as unconcernedly--much more unconcernedly than I'd kill a
superfluous litter of kittens brought into the world by the family cat."

Doubt his sanity I might and did, but of his seriousness and sincerity
I was in no sense sceptical. If I refused to speak, the chances were
that I should not be allowed to leave the place alive. In the matter
of personal strength, I was hopelessly outmatched, and as my revolver
had dropped out of my hand when I had received the blow which felled
me, and had been secured by him, I was, save for a pocket-knife,
entirely unarmed.

All things considered, to tell him my story seemed the best course
to pursue. He would learn very little that mattered or that he could
not find out without me; whereas it was quite possible that if, in
return, I could induce him to speak of the "cause" to which he was so
warmly attached, and in the interests of which he was ready to stop at
nothing, I might, on the contrary, learn something which would be very
well worth the knowing.

"I'll tell you my story," I bargained, "if you in return will tell me
what is this cause which you say you have at heart. Who knows that it
might not be a cause with which I myself sympathise, and might wish to
befriend?"

"I agree," he said quietly. "But first I think we'll shut the door and
have a light. I've been in this place before. If I can help it, I never
enter any place without finding out all I can about it beforehand.
There's a gas-jet, and if you'll wait a moment, I'll light it. It can't
be seen from the outside."

Commencing with the invitation to write an article on the opium den, I
very briefly narrated what had befallen me, keeping back nothing except
my love for Kate, and the fact of the dream-tableaux, neither of which
seemed to me to come within my bargain.

He listened without a comment, though he now and then interpolated a
pointed question. When I had done, he lit a cigarette, and began to
pace backward and forward.

"Mr. Rissler," he said abruptly, after a short silence, "were you ever
poor?"

"Ever poor?" I laughed. "If you had asked me if I were ever rich, I
might, by thinking hard, remember a time when I had a few pounds in
hand. But ever poor? My dear sir, I can't recall a time when I was ever
anything else."

He nodded gravely.

"I have heard your story. Now listen to mine. I'm not without hope of
enlisting your sympathy. Not for myself: I need, and will have, the
sympathy of no man; but for the cause for which I fight, for which I
hope and believe I shall be able to persuade you to fight. My mother
was a poor woman--a woman of the people; my father--my God! the irony
of it--a gentleman. He was, if the truth were known, something more
than a gentleman. We are all gentlemen to-day, or think we are, and
one has to make a distinction. He was more than a gentleman. He was
an aristocrat. He was more, even, than an aristocrat; but we will not
talk further of that now. She was my mother, but not his wife. She
was the mother of his child, and he left her and her child to starve.
We did not starve; but I pass over those years. When I was ten, she
broke down, worked out, worn out, wearied out. Then I took over her
burden. No matter what my work, no matter who my employer. There are
thousands of such employers as he; there are millions of such workers
as I--workers whom no law protects. You may not be cruel to a cat
or dog; you may not over-work a horse. These are offences which are
punishable by law. But your fellow-men and fellow-women, your clerk,
your shop-assistant, your warehouse-man--these you may starve, sweat,
over-work, underpay, these you may do to death if you like, and none
shall say you nay. The sweating, the over-work, and the underpay are
the least of the evils they endure.

"The one and only aim of most employers is making money. And 'making'
money means _taking_ money, the money which is the rightful property
of others--means, in point of fact, swindling. But a good business man
is shy of swindling his customers. The customer is a free agent. If
he discovers he is being swindled he will take his custom elsewhere,
and loss of custom means loss of money, which will not suit your
business man. So he must needs look for somebody else to sweat and
swindle--somebody who cannot take himself elsewhere at choice; and in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, the somebodies are the unfortunate
employees. They must be made to do the greatest possible amount of
work at the least possible rate of pay. And that they be compelled to
endure this wholesale blood-sucking and robbery, they must of necessity
be kept in a state of subjection, of fear, of slavery, and bondage.
All feeling of independence, of having a soul or a conscience to call
their own, must be taken from them. They are the chattels of their
master, the creatures of his will, depending--they and their wife and
child, if wife or child there be--upon his whim and pleasure for the
roof which covers their head, for the clothes they wear, for the very
food which keeps body and soul together. Let them once feel any sense
of independence--let them once feel that they can obtain shelter and
clothes and food at the hands of another employer, and they will no
longer consent to be sweated and robbed, underfed, underpaid, and
overworked.

"There are several ways of bringing the unhappy employees to this state
of servile subjection. One is to browbeat, to bully, and to intimidate,
till their nerve be gone and their spirit be broken. But why stand it,
you ask? Why not throw off these chains, and seek work at the hands
of some employer who is considerate and just. The reason is that such
an employer is not easy to find, and, when found, the chances are a
hundred to one against his having a vacancy on his staff.

"Every man in a situation knows that there are thousands out, and
that, were he to resign his post, it would be filled, almost at a
moment's notice, and at any wage which an employer chose to offer. Such
knowledge as that gives pause to the man who is minded to assert his
independence, for out of his meagre salary it is almost impossible to
save; and to be out of work even for a week or two, with nothing to
fall back upon, means not only starvation for him and his, but means
that every week he is out, the longer is he likely to remain so. It
means shabby clothes; for how, without money, can he buy new clothes
to keep up the appearance which is of so much importance to him when
applying for a post? It means that in an incredibly short time he
begins to look shabby and broken-down--begins to look, in fact, like
one of life's derelicts, and, of life's derelicts, employers are apt to
fight shy.

"Another reason why a man hesitates to throw off his chains is that
some employers have been known to refuse a character to the clerk or
assistant who has asserted his independence, and the independence of
his class, by discharging himself; and at the man who comes seeking
work, without a 'character,' no other employer will look. For an
employee to dare to prove that he has been overworked and underpaid
by discharging himself, and finding new employment, where the work is
less and the rate of pay higher, would be an example (your employer
argues) which would demoralise the whole staff. Such a state of things
approaches to sacrilege, blasphemy, anarchy. It must not be permitted.
Of the man who dares so to act, so to set employers as a class at
defiance, an object-lesson must be made, lest so dangerous an example
infect the workers who remain. I have known cases where, to such a man,
not only has a character been refused, but where a trumped-up charge
of theft, or insubordination, or other misconduct, has been brought
against him, that he and his fellow-slaves may be taught the salutary
lesson that, against Capital, Labour has no chance; against the
employer, the employee has no appeal. It is slavery, a thousand times
worse than that of the Chinese coolies about which some good folk have
such tender consciences.

"In England we do not flog our white slaves. We only break their
nerves, crush their spirit, and bully the manhood out of them. Two of
my fellow-workers went out of their minds; one of us took his own
life. You look incredulous--you think that sort of thing uncommon. They
haven't enough mind left, most of them, to go out of it, so abject and
cringing and timid do they become; and they haven't enough pluck left
in them--broken-spirited as they are--to take their lives. So they only
die, the weakly ones, or drag out their wretched lives, the strong
ones, in daily terror of being discharged and of being thrown homeless,
moneyless, to starve upon the streets. Perhaps to starve, and so to
make an end of it, would be the best thing that could happen to them.
For many employers, in addition to the sweating, encourage a system
which leaves their employees with less spirit to call their own than a
dog, less soul in their wretched bodies than a worm.

"In many business houses a system of espionage is established by which
the wretched workers are encouraged to sneak and pry and play the
cut-throat upon each other. If your fellow-slave gets two shillings a
week more than you get, and you can detect him in a moment's slackness,
a single mistake, and report it to the employer, it is possible that
the poor wretch may be discharged and you may get his post and his
extra pay. But you, in your turn, know that the man immediately below
you is watching you greedily and in the same way, lest you, also,
be guilty of a slip or an omission that, by reporting the matter
to his principals, he may work you out, as you had worked out your
predecessor, and so he may slip into your vacant shoes and your pay.

"It is a system of infamy--a system which breeds men and women who are
lower in the scale of being than a louse. You think I exaggerate. But
do you know what it is to wake up each morning so weary that you had
scarce the strength to struggle up that you might go forth to work for
the day's bread?

"I do, and so do tens of thousands in this London to-day.

"Do you know what it is to be so broken of spirit, so weary of the
cringing and the fawning, as to feel, each morning, that if death
had come to you in the night, and so spared you this waking, you had
counted it a happy release?

"I do, and so do tens of thousands in this London to-day.

"And, more terrible still, do you know what it is to be so abject
a thing, so infamous a creature, that you are content to play the
cut-throat to your fellow-slave, to pry and spy and carry tales, in
the hope that you may be appointed to replace him, and so put another
shilling a week in your own pocket, and another sovereign in that of
the tyrant and blood-sucker, to curry favour with whom you are ready to
do this infamous thing?

"Again I say I do; again I say, and so do tens of thousands in this
city of London to-day.

"For me those days of slavery and infamy are gone. For millions of my
fellow-men and fellow-women those days of slavery and infamy remain;
but a man who has once been through what I have, who has lived and
starved and eaten his heart out among the poor in their squalid, sordid
surroundings, can never forget it so long as he lives. Their cry is
ever in my ears; the cry of men whom these monsters have made less
than men, breaking the man's heart in them, turning them into curs
and cravens, robbing them of the very birthright of their manhood,
that, like bullocks and steers, they may be broken to bow themselves
to the yoke and lash, and meekly to obey their tyrant's bidding. The
cry of wan-faced, hollow-eyed women, working a week of winter days
and nights in a fireless garret till their chilled fingers can scarce
hold the needle, and for a wage, that on the streets to which--small
wonder!--such women are, by starvation and despair, too often driven,
can be earned at so light a cost. But most of all, the cry of little
children--little hollow-eyed children, crying silently because they are
hungry and cold, stretching wan hands for the bread----My God! I cannot
bear to think of it; I shall go mad. I sometimes think I _am_ mad when
I brood over their sufferings and their wrongs. A great writer has put
it on record that when he looks upon his fellow-men and fellow-women,
and remembers that pain and sorrow and disease, for themselves and
their dear ones, are the inevitable lot of all, and death the only
certainty--when he sees them smiling, flirting, posturing, grimacing on
the very edge of Eternity, he is filled with amazement and contempt.

"Contempt! To me the sight of haggard, careworn men, of weary-faced
and unlovely women, leading starved and joyless lives, out of which
all hope and beauty and poetry are irretrievably crushed and gone,
yet forcing themselves, in face of such terrible odds, to smile and
laugh and take life lightly--is a sight for gods to wonder at, is
magnificent, is heroic, is sublime.

"And me, God has upraised to right the wrongs of the poor. The love
that I bear to these my people, of whom I am one, burns more steadily
than ever within me; but side by side with it there has sprung up
a fiercer flame--the fires of fierce and relentless hate of their
oppressors. Me, God has marked out to be the avenger of the poor.

"As God sent the rainbow as a sign to his servant Noah, so to me by a
sign has He signified His will. To me, as I walked the streets of this
great city, a message came, bidding me turn my steps to the nation's
museum, there to seek the sign. And in the Egyptian court of the museum
I found it. There, stretching half the length of that great hall,
where stand the sarcophagi of Israel's taskmasters, the Pharaohs, is a
clenched arm and fist, of solid granite, and of such giant proportions,
that one single blow from it would make to fall the side of a house,
and bring to death and destruction all who dwell therein.

"And as I looked the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 'Behold, I
make of thee My fist and arm of granite, that thou mayest strike and
slay without mercy My enemies and thy enemies, them that oppress and
grind down My people. Strike then, slay and spare not, else shall it
be to thee as to Saul, who, when bidden by Me utterly to destroy the
Amalekites, spared many, bringing thereby upon himself and upon his
house the just and heavy vengeance of God.'"

The man was mad--mad as it is possible for a man to be; but there was
method in his madness. In all that had been said, no single word had
been dropped which afforded any clue in regard to the crimes he had
committed or meant to commit. Passionate as had been his outpourings
in the cause of the poor and of the oppressed, and vehement as had
been his declaration of war against the oppressor, he had given me no
inkling of the means at his command for the carrying on of the war he
was waging, no clue in regard to his associates, their methods, or
their meeting-places. Not one word of all he had said could be adduced
against him in court, as evidence in connection with any crime with
which he might be charged.

Then from under his cape of Christ-like compassion, the cunning and
cruel eyes of the madman peeped.

"But I mustn't tell you too much--anything you could use against me,"
he said with a leer, "until I know whether you are for the oppressor
or the oppressed. Tell me you are on our side, Rissler, and none shall
raise finger to harm or to injure you.

"But"--and now his voice was terrible to hear, the blue blaze in his
eyes terrible to see--"let me have cause to suspect you of assisting
the enemy, the people's enemy, God's enemy, and I'd throttle the life
out of you, tear the heart out of you, this night, this moment, in this
place. Which is it to be?"



THE DUMPLING'S SECRET.


The man, as I have said before, was mad--stark, staring mad, and
with a madman one must go warily. Had I too profusely protested my
sympathy, too readily declared myself an adherent, his cunning would,
I am persuaded, have led him to doubt my sincerity, in which case his
promise to strangle the life, or to tear the heart out of me, would, I
believe, have been fulfilled.

Under the circumstances I thought it best not to appear too eager.

"You can't frighten me with your threats," I said, quietly. "I did lose
my nerve some time ago. But I've got it back again now, and while I'm
willing to hear all you have to say about a cause with which I'm not
only ready but anxious to throw in my lot, I'm not going to be bounced
or threatened into doing so. The co-operation of a man who, in making
so momentous a choice, is capable of being threatened or talked into
standing in with you, who jumps, in fact, to your whistling, isn't
worth having. There are more momentous matters than my life hanging to
this, and before I say definitely I'm with you--as is my wish--there
are one or two more questions I must ask."

With no one will an appeal to sanity find more favour than with the
insane. "Do let us be reasonable" is the best of all arguments to use
to those whose reason is affected. Evidently the man before me was
favourably impressed by what I had said.

"You are quite right," he replied cordially. "We want the co-operation
of no one who is not persuaded in his own mind of the righteousness of
our cause. From what I've seen of you, Mr. Rissler, you are just the
sort of man with whom I should like to be associated in my work. Your
getting out of that opium den with a whole skin when, believing you
to be Grant, I'd given the strictest orders that you shouldn't leave
the place alive, proves you to be a man ready of resource and quick
of brain, just such a man whose co-operation would ensure the final
success of the cause. It will be a red-letter day for us if we could
induce you to throw in your lot with us. Ask your questions, then, and
I'll give you a straight reply."

"Well," I said, "tell me in a word what is the end at which you are
aiming."

"I'm aiming," he said, "to create first in England, and afterwards
all over the world, such an upheaval of the social order of things as
took place in France at the time of the Great Revolution. But with
this difference. The French Revolution was aimed at the aristocrat.
You'll think me inconsistent, I fear, when I say that it is not
with the aristocrat that I have my chief quarrel. I hold no brief
for the aristocracy. Many of them--most of them, perhaps--are lazy,
extravagant, self-indulgent, luxury-loving, selfish, and vicious,
as I know to my cost. I don't blame them very much for that, any
more than I blame the very poor for their want of cleanliness,
their thriftlessness, their hand-to-mouth methods of living, and
for seeking solace from the cold, the squalor, and the misery of
their surroundings, in the warmth and light and companionship of
the public-house. Both classes are to some extent the outcome of
circumstances. The aristocracy have most of them their sense of
_noblesse oblige_, and have the honour of a great name to keep up.
On the whole, they do it tolerably well. They distribute largess
generously, they entertain lavishly, they pay those who work for them
fairly, and they treat those who work for them well. The aristocracy,
it is true, has got, first, to give way, and, ultimately, to go, just
as the monarchy has got to give way and to go before the advance of
democracy.

"Do you know what King Edward--wise man! foreseeing man!--is reported
to have said? I tell it to you as it was told to me. It may be true, or
it may not. Personally, I believe it is, and it adds to the admiration
to which, in spite of myself, I am compelled, for his wisdom and for
his foresight. He is reported to have said, 'My grandson is likely to
be the last King of England. The whole face of things is changing, not
in this country only, but in Germany, Austria, Russia, in Europe, and
all over the world. The monarchy will last my time. It may last my
son's. Possibly it will last his son's time. I shall not be there to
see. But those who are alive, when my grandson dies, may possibly see
an end of the monarchy in England!'

"That is what King Edward is reported to have said, and whether he
said it or did not say it, it is true. We are on the verge of a death
struggle between the masses and the classes. Much will depend upon the
side with which the great middle classes throw in their lot. If the
middle classes decide for what we call the classes, the struggle will
necessarily be prolonged. If the middle classes decide, as I believe
they will, for the masses, the end will come soon, and with awful
swiftness. One of the two--the masses or the classes--must go. Can you
doubt for one moment which it will be? Even now the death-knell of the
monarchy and the aristocracy is sounding. Already the day of democracy
has dawned. King Labour is coming into his own.

"But the democracy of to-day doesn't see the real danger in front of
it. It is so busy, abusing and striving to sweep away the monarchy and
the aristocracy, that it doesn't see that it is playing into the hands
of an infinitely greater danger--the plutocracy.

"As things stand now, King and Court and House of Lords are some sort
of check upon the encroachments of the plutocracy. Sweep King and
Court and House of Lords away, and the country will be at the mercy of
the mere man of money. And what will the poor get out of _him_? Better
a thousand times for the poor to be in the hands--be under the heels,
if you like--of the monarchy and the aristocracy, than be given over,
tied hand and foot, to the tender mercies of the mere money-grabber,
with no name to uphold, no sense of chivalry to inspire, no conscience
to control, no object in life, save to get and keep and grind out
money from man, woman, and child. It is _not_ the monarchy or the
aristocracy who is the enemy of the people. It is your capitalist,
your mill and factory owner, your middleman, your wholesale and retail
merchants, your employers of labour. It is against him and all of his
tribe that I would stir up a revolution in England which should make as
clean a sweep of the lot of them as the French Revolution made of the
aristocrat.

"Do I carry you with me thus far, Mr. Rissler? If not, it were idle to
say more."

"You carry me completely," I replied, "But--forgive me asking--how is
what you propose accomplishing to be done? Thus far you have dealt
only in generalisations, but generalisations by themselves never yet
brought about a revolution."

"You are absolutely right," he replied quickly. "In the ordinary way
I should say it could not be done for another twenty, thirty, perhaps
another hundred years. There is only one way; but there _is_ a way.
There is only one man who can do it; but there is such a man, as you
yourself will admit when you hear his name."

He stopped, and for at least half a minute looked at me searchingly, as
if uncertain how far he was justified in taking me into his confidence,
but muttering to himself meanwhile, in language which, by the word or
two I caught, I knew to be French. So close was his face to mine that I
saw what at first I thought was my own face mirrored in his eyes. But,
as I looked, the picture-face in his eyes became more definite, and I
knew that the face I saw there was not mine. It was a face there was
no mistaking; a face which every schoolboy, every child, would have
recognised at sight.

And now it seemed to be growing larger until what had been a tiny
picture, in the pupils of the Dumpling's eyes, was the life-size head
of a man, looking at me with eyes of its own--eyes so stern, so cold,
so cruel, so commanding, that the bidding of the set lips beneath them
few men would dare to disobey. At the bidding of those lips, at one
glance from those eyes--men, regiments, an army, even, had gone forth
unhesitatingly to die.

That all this could be seen in the picture, which is formed in the
pupils of one man's eyes, sounds incredible, and I can only explain it
by saying that what I saw lay not in the pupils themselves, but lay
behind those pupils, through which I looked as one looks through a
window.

Then suddenly the face which I had seen faded away. Silhouetted against
the sky, I saw the solitary figure of a man standing upon the rocky
point of an island, and looking out--the soul of him more lonely than
that lone island, so far away from other land, and surrounded by a
wasteful wilderness of waters--the heart of him torn with unrest,
wilder, sadder, more hopeless, than the surging, sobbing unrest of
those surrounding seas.

Then, too, this picture faded, and I was looking upon the face of the
Dumpling, and listening to the words which fell sharply, incisively,
from his lips.

Clearly he had decided to trust me with his great secret, and something
of the excitement which I saw upon his face communicated itself to me
as I listened.

"Why has the Great Revolution, why has the cause of Labour failed
thus far?" he asked, turning upon me almost savagely. "I will tell
you," he went on, without waiting for an answer. "Because great
revolutions are only brought about by great men; and for ten, twenty,
thirty years, perhaps more, the womb of England has been barren of
great men. The histories of religions, we are told, are written in
the life-stories of great men. The histories of politics are no more
than the life-stories of great men. To-day there are parties, but
no politics. What are your Labour party, your Liberal party, if you
like--your Campbell-Bannermans, Asquiths, Bryces, Birrells, Morleys,
Burnses, Keir Hardies? Amiable men, able men, capable men, well-meaning
men, conscientious men, but spoken of in a comparative sense, as
compared with your real makers of history, of statecraft, what are
they? Mediocrities, every one of them. Parnell had it in his power
to have been a great man had he lived, and had he not made a mess
of his life, but for the rest"--he stopped short for a moment--"for
the rest," he went on, "judged by any standard of greatness, for the
rest"--he snapped his fingers contemptuously--"that! The whole of
them combined couldn't do in a year what one great man--a Napoleon,
for instance--could do in an hour. The great revolution has failed
of coming thus far, the cause of Labour has failed thus far, for one
reason, and one reason only--there is no Napoleon to lead the people to
victory. Once find Labour her Napoleon, and Labour will rule the land.

"Listen!

"I who stand before you am he--not Labour's Napoleon only, not merely
the Napoleon of Labour, but Napoleon the Corsican, Napoleon the First
Consul, Napoleon the Emperor himself! In me you see not only Napoleon
re-incarnate, but Napoleon's very self--the conqueror of Europe, the
Cæsar of France, now come again to earth, even as the Christ came two
thousand years ago, to save and to redeem the people. I am here to
lead the leaderless armies of Labour to victory--I am here to set King
Labour on his rightful throne. The world has waited over-long for the
coming of Napoleon. But at last he is come. I who stand before you am
he!"



THE NEW NAPOLEON.


"You say--I read it in your eyes--that I am mad," the Dumpling went
on, after a pause. "Wait and see. If mad I am, then mad were Cæsar,
Alexander, Moses--mad even perhaps the Christ Himself.

"You say--again I see it in your eyes--you say: 'This man claims to be
Napoleon, and condescends to become a criminal, a thief, a concocter
of plots to entrap and kidnap millionaires.' But listen. Napoleon is
unchanged. Should I, a hundred years ago, have hesitated to torture
a rich Jew--had I so chosen--to wring from him his millions for the
carrying on of my wars? Money I must have. Money I will have, if I am
to lead the legions of Labour to victory. These millionaires, these
wealthy parvenus whom I hold to ransom, are but the base pawns in the
game, from whom I wring the means of carrying on my war. I stop at
nothing. I scruple at nothing, so long as I achieve my end. At this
moment the mines are laid for a revolution which shall shake England
to its centre. I, who hold the strands of the whole network of the
conspiracy in my single hand, have not scrupled, in laying and carrying
out my plans, to use base tools--thieves and rogues and criminals. What
are they to me? I achieve my purpose. That is enough.

"And now again I read your thoughts, and this time you say: 'This man,
this Cæsar in conception, this criminal in act, preaches humanity and
practises inhumanity; this man speaks of the poor with Christ-like
compassion, even while his hands are red with his fellow-creatures'
blood.' But whom have I slain? _My_ enemies? Never! _My_ enemies,
_my_ deadliest enemy, I would not stoop so much as to strike across
the face. But God's enemies, the enemies of God's cause, against them
I will use all the cunning and craft of my brain, to wipe them off
the face of the earth. This negro of whom you have spoken, this man
Black Sam--he was slain at my command because he was the enemy of God,
the enemy of God's cause. It was he who betrayed us to Grant, the
detective. Therefore I slew him. Therefore would I slay a thousand
such as he. When I was on earth a hundred years ago, I never counted
the cost. I have sent regiments to certain destruction that I might
carry out my end. And am I changed? Yes; changed, inasmuch as, to-day,
I would sacrifice not a regiment, but an army--not a legion, but a
whole nation--so long as I attained my end. Am I not Napoleon? And does
Napoleon ever count the cost?"

Then, all in a moment, he ceased his restless pacings, starting back
and staggering wildly at some sudden thought, as a hit soldier starts
and staggers when he feels the bullet.

"My God!" he cried piteously, "I am forgetting! This man, this young
Grant whom to-night I killed, thinking him to be his brother, was no
enemy of the Cause! My hands are red with innocent blood. I have done
murder! I have slain an innocent man. Ah! if he have wife and child--a
wife whom I have made a widow, a child whom my hands have orphaned! My
God! My God! Have pity on them! Protect them, comfort them, for I Thy
servant have done this thing. I have taken innocent blood!"

I have seen strange sights in my somewhat adventurous life, but a
stranger spectacle than this madman, this wholesale murderer, the
blood of whose recent victims was surely as yet wet and warm upon his
hands, pacing backwards and forwards, his face literally distorted by
anguish of soul, as he cried out upon God to have pity upon the victims
of his crime, I am not likely soon to see again.

As he spoke, and as I stood watching him in amazement, there was a
sound like the scrunching of feet on the loose gravel outside.

Then a voice:

"There's someone in there, I'll swear, sergeant. Didn't you hear 'em
speaking? Turn your bullseye this way a moment, will you?... Ah! Would
you? Lay hold of him, sergeant; he's past me. Quick--or he'll get away!"

At the first hint of a sound outside, the Dumpling had turned off
the gas and stepped softly, swiftly to the door. As it opened I
saw the figures of the two policemen, their helmets and shoulders
outlined darkly but clearly against the light which streamed from the
incandescent gas-lamp in the side street, their lower limbs and feet
lost in the shadow thrown by the garden wall. I was too dazzled by
the sudden flashing of the bullseye to see more than that the Dumpling
was making a desperate dash for liberty; but my ears told me the rest.



The Dumpling had got clean away, perhaps to put the fuse to the mines
of which he had spoken as laid and ready, and to spring upon a startled
country the surprise of his great rebellion.

I heard his footsteps and the footsteps of his out-distanced, defeated
pursuers die away in the distance, and then, creeping noiselessly out,
I scaled the wall and made my way home to my own rooms and to bed. I
had had more than enough of adventure for one night.



THE KINDNESS--AND UNKINDNESS--OF KATE.


When I awoke next morning it was with a singular feeling of
depression--the reaction, I told myself, from the excitement of the
last few days. Life seemed flat and at loose ends. I was in love, with
small prospect of bringing my suit to a successful issue. Nor, in the
matter of the Dumpling, could I persuade myself that I had any reason
for self-congratulation. I had heroically set out to trap and to catch
a criminal, instead of which I had been made a prisoner myself.

That I was here in bed, and between the blankets, was due neither
to my own skill nor to my own strength, for I had been hopelessly
outwitted in the former quality, and ignominiously made to feel my own
inferiority in the latter. That I was here at all, instead perhaps of
lying strangled in a cellar, was due to the arrival of the police on
the previous evening.

Had their appearance not cut short my discussion with the Dumpling,
the issue of that discussion might have been disastrous to myself. The
most difficult part of my task--to convince the Dumpling that I was
sufficiently in sympathy with himself and with his projects, safely to
be allowed at large--was all to come. In dealing with a madman, one
never knows what sudden warp his cunning and his mania will take; and
but for the interruption, it might have been my life, instead of the
conversation, which was prematurely cut short.

Another reason for my feeling thus stale and "cheap" on this particular
morning was that the ardour with which I had taken up the hunting down
of the Dumpling had considerably cooled. I am sympathetic by nature,
and, mad though he was, this man's passionate denunciation of the
wrongs of the poor, and the terrible and, I fear, only too true picture
which he had drawn of their sufferings, had strangely moved me. The
tragedy of poverty, the fact that a man's spirit could be so broken,
that he could be brought to such infamy as to pawn his very manhood,
to become, as the Dumpling had said, like bullocks and steers, and to
bow his head to the yoke, for the sake of a roof to cover the heads
of wife and children; the fact that women could be brought to such a
pass as to be compelled to choose between starvation or the streets,
had come home to me with new and awful significance. Even as out of
the mouth of babes and sucklings God brings forth wisdom, so out of
the mouth of a madman and a fanatic had some of the sternest and most
terrible facts of life been brought to my realisation.

When such things could be, it seemed to me that to be spending time
and strength in playing at being a detective, and in writing what a
newspaper once aptly described as "harmless little tales with titles
that appal," was almost criminal. I was more than minded to throw the
whole thing up, and to occupy myself, instead, in doing what little I
could to relieve the suffering of my less fortunate fellow-creatures.

With these thoughts still seething in my brain, I dressed, and after
breakfasting, sallied out to make my report to Miss Clara.

She received me with the same cordiality with which we had parted, and
on learning that I had news to impart, sent word to that effect to
Kate, who, she said, would be equally interested to hear it.

I told my story, just as I have set it down in the previous chapter,
omitting nothing, and giving the Dumpling's words in regard to the poor
and their sufferings almost as those words had fallen from his lips.

Upon one of my listeners, at least, the narrative had a most unexpected
effect. Kate heard me throughout with very evident sympathy, and was
clearly alarmed and disturbed at the risk I had run in my encounter
with the Dumpling. Otherwise she was not in any sense moved. But
upon the elder woman's face, as I unfolded my story, there suddenly
came a look like that of one who has received a crushing blow. For a
moment or two I feared she was about to faint; but by an effort she
collected herself, and sat out the remainder of the recital quietly and
impassively.

When I had made an end of my narrative her only comment was, "Quite
exciting, I'm sure!" Then she rose, and walking to the door, beckoned
Kate to her. Whispering a few words in the girl's ears--not more than a
dozen at most--she passed out.

Kate turned to me.

"Mr. Rissler," she said, "I want you to promise that you will do
nothing of the sort again."

"Nothing of what sort, Miss Carleton?" I asked, wondering whether she
was speaking for herself, or from instructions she had received from
her aunt.

"This detective work?" she replied.

"But why?" I asked. "What difference can it make to you in what way I
employ myself?"

"For one thing," she said ruefully, "you'll be killed to a certainty.
This dreadful man is clearly too clever for you."

"I fail to see the certainty, either of my being killed or of my being
so hopelessly outwitted in cleverness," I replied stiffly; for it was
somewhat mortifying to one's pride thus to be pronounced a fool and a
failure.

"Besides, even if it be so," I added ungenerously, "my getting killed,
or not killed, is my own affair, and cannot greatly concern you, to
whom--as you reminded me yesterday--I am a stranger."

"Well, so you were--then. Almost a stranger, that is," she added,
diplomatically. "But, you see, we know something more of you now.
Promise you'll give it up from this time forth--'d'reckly moment,' as I
used to say when I was a child, and was too impatient to wait for what
I wanted."

On my first meeting with this extraordinary young woman I had been
very properly snubbed and put in my place. On my second, I had been
coldly informed that I must consider myself a stranger--as if only
by effacing my previous behaviour entirely from her memory could my
undesirable presence be endured at all. Yet now, on our third meeting,
she was pouting her dainty lips at me, and pleading, in the prettiest
way possible, that I would reconstruct and re-order my entire life to
humour her unaccountable caprice.

Extraordinary, inexplicable, as her conduct was, the novelty of
finding myself in the _rôle_ of someone who was to be considered and
conciliated, instead of a nobody who was to be effaced and ignored, was
highly agreeable. Even had I been disposed to accede, off-hand, to her
request--which I certainly was not--the situation was too pleasant for
me to wish prematurely to end it.

"But why," I asked, "should you wish me to give up my detective work,
or trouble yourself about me at all?"

"You are very unkind," she said, suddenly breaking down and, to my
indescribable astonishment and dismay, bursting into tears.

Recalling, at this lapse of time, the course of our conversation on
that occasion, I do not consider that I was guilty of any unpardonable
offence against good taste or good manners; but at the moment, and
at sight of her tears, my behaviour struck me as blackguardly beyond
belief.

"Oh, please, Miss Carleton, don't cry!" I gasped imploringly. "I was
a beast, a blackguard, a bully. Forgive me--won't you forgive me?
I wouldn't do or say or even think a thing that would hurt you for
worlds--for--for--I--I--love you. I loved you from the moment I saw you
in the boat. I shall love you as long as ever I live."

When, for the first time, a man tells a woman, and with evident
sincerity, that he loves her, he not unnaturally expects that she would
receive his declaration with some consciousness of the fact that what
he says is, to him at least, a matter of supreme importance. Kate, on
the contrary, took my avowal with what I considered ill-timed levity.
Possibly that avowal told her nothing of which she was not already
aware; possibly she did not approve of the suddenness with which I had
sprung it upon her, or of the unconventionality of my wooing; possibly
she merely wished to gain time before giving me an answer. Be that as
it may, she not only proved herself to be a very self-possessed young
person, but a calculating little body into the bargain. Having brought
me metaphorically to my knees, having reduced me to a condition in
which I was not likely to deny her anything, she suddenly released one
eye from the eclipsing handkerchief which, a moment before, had hidden
both. Regarding me out of the corner of this eye, but with the other
still behind the handkerchief--like a horseman who, with one foot in
the stirrup, waits the final word which shall decide whether he is to
ride away or to stay--she smiled at me through her tears, and with the
air of one making a bargain said:

"Then you promise?"

"Promise what?" I asked.

"To give up this detective work."

"Why, no! I can't promise that," I replied.

"I hate you! I hate you!" she cried, and, springing to her feet, flung
angrily out of the room.



THE INEXPLICABLE CONDUCT OF MISS CLARA.


A younger and more pessimistically disposed man than I might
conceivably have been plunged into the depths of despair at being thus
told by the woman he loved that she hated him. But, on the whole, I
was not inclined to be altogether dissatisfied with the interview.
Never before--even though her words were sympathetic and her manner
not unkindly--had she failed to make me realise that I was kept at a
distance; that I was an unvouched-for stranger, between whom and her
the barriers of custom and convention still necessarily existed. But
her words and her acts of to-day--so it seemed to me--were a tacit
admission that the barrier had been removed. She had concerned herself
sufficiently in my career to express a wish in regard to it (though
here I fear she acted on her aunt's instigation rather than from any
impulse or inclination of her own); she had made the granting of that
wish a favour to herself, and had even suffered me to declare my love
unreproved. Her tears had, I admit, at the moment utterly dismayed me;
but remembering the subsequent by-play of the uneclipsed eye, I was
now disposed to think either that those tears were caused by pique at
the fact that I had not more promptly acceded to her request, or that
they were no more than the legitimate use of a woman's natural weapon
for the confounding and undoing of man. Possibly, too--so I tried to
persuade myself--the exclamation "I hate you--I hate you!" was less an
expression of personal dislike than a pretty woman's very pardonable
exhibition of captiousness at finding herself thwarted where she had
expected immediate submission and consent. With the assistance of Miss
Clara, I hoped soon to regain whatever ground I had lost in her niece's
favour, and as, after leaving us, the older lady had made straight for
the garden, and had (as I could see from the window) been pacing it
bareheaded, hands clasped behind her and deep in thought, I ventured to
lift the window, and to ask her to spare me a moment before I went.

She came in at once, looking, I thought, a trifle tired and pale, but
otherwise all trace of agitation was gone, and she spoke with all her
usual self-possession.

"Mr. Rissler," she said, coming to the point as usual, the instant the
door was closed; "what have you and Clara been talking about?"

"My work," I answered laconically. "I'm to throw up crime
investigation, and devote myself to something else."

"And you have promised?"

"Well, no, I haven't. I had the temerity to ask for some reason why
I should be called upon to take so extraordinary a course, with the
result that your niece first burst into tears, and then flung out of
the room in a passion. Do you know why?"

She did not condescend to answer.

"Mr. Rissler," she said, "give up this detective work at once. Devote
all your time to book-writing, and I'll stand your friend. Refuse, and
you do not enter the house or see Clara again."

"The devil is in it!" I exclaimed rudely and with exasperation. "I'll
do anything to please you, who have proved yourself so true and so
generous a friend. But surely I'm entitled to a reason. I admit
frankly that I'm less keen on this work than I was before I heard the
Dumpling's passionate plea for the poor--a plea which seemed to me a
sort of conscription, calling upon and compelling every able-bodied man
to enlist himself and to take up arms in so sacred a cause. I don't
say that I mightn't see my way, sooner or later, perhaps even at once,
to give up the detective business, if giving it up means pleasing you
and winning your niece--who, by the bye, has just done me the honour
to declare that she hates me, so there seems small enough occasion to
consider that aspect of the case. But when a man has devoted years of
his life to any particular career, and has even made some small success
at it, you can hardly expect him to throw up everything at a moment's
notice, and without any sort of reason being given for the request.
What is your reason? What is your niece's reason? For some reason the
two of you must surely have."

"It isn't respectable, for one thing," replied Aunt Clara doggedly.

"Respectable!" I said. "Is that it? Frankly, I have always felt that
there isn't very much difference, after all, between the man who uses
his brains to track down and to capture a criminal--as a detective
does--and the man who uses his brains to make out a case against the
criminal and get him convicted--as the barrister does--and the man
who, after he has listened to all that can be said about the case
by everybody concerned, sums it up, and, when a verdict has been
returned, passes sentence. They are all three--judge, barrister, and
detective--officers of the law and servants of the King and of the
public; and I'm not sure that the detective's isn't the most important
and useful work of the three. Anyhow, it is the most difficult."

"Bosh!" said Miss Clara shortly. "You'll be telling me next that you
might just as well be a hangman, for _he's_ as much an officer of the
law and a servant of the King and of the public as the other three; and
so, according to your showing, equally respectable. Bosh, Mr. Rissler!
Bosh!"

"All right. Bosh it is, then!" I replied amicably. "Anything for a
quiet life, and I admit I hadn't thought of your holding trumps all
the time, and playing the hangman card. Anyhow, I'm answered on that
score. What a wonderful woman you are! Judge, barrister, and detective
all rolled into one. A great lawyer was lost to the world when it was
decided that you should come into it wearing petticoats instead of a
wig and gown."

"You're a fool!" said Miss Clara, not ill-pleased, in spite of the
uncompromising plainness of her language.

"And now, what about the detective business?" she went on. "Are you
going to give it up, or are you not? For you have got to decide one way
or the other before you come here again. I wouldn't see my niece for
the present, if I were you. She'll come round in time, like the rest
of us, if she's left alone. There's nothing a woman hates so much as
being taken at her word, and left alone. There are many more women who
have gone back on what they'd said, and let a man have his own way,
after swearing they wouldn't--there are many more who have done that,
and been brought round to another way of thinking, just by being left
alone, than by any other way. Pestering a woman, pleading with her,
imploring her, is precious little use. You take the tip from me, young
man--I know."

"You're a wonder, Miss Carleton, as I said before," I answered. "And
I'll take a tip from you as eagerly as I'd take a kiss, if you'd give
me one."

"Oh, bosh! Don't bother me! You're a fool--as I told you before," she
retorted. "But think it over; take time, if you like, but think it
over, and if you are a wise man and decide to do as I wish, as both of
us wish, I'll stand your friend."

"Miss Carleton," I said, "I'll be frank with you. It doesn't want
much thinking over. I had thought it over before I came here, and
had practically decided for the present, at all events, to leave the
detective work alone. The singular and to me entirely inexplicable
attitude which you and your niece have chosen to take up, in giving
me, so to speak, an ultimatum either to drop the work or to consider
myself forbidden this house, aroused, just for a moment, an Irishman's
love of fight, an Irishman's cussedness and contradictoriness. But
I'll do as you say, and for the present, at all events, will leave
Dumpling-hunting and detective work alone. I don't make any great
sacrifice in doing so, as far as the Dumpling is concerned; for when he
went away he was in too much of a hurry to leave me his visiting card,
and I don't know where to find him if I wanted to. The only clue I have
to him is concerned with this house, the doors of which, unless I drop
detective work, must, you say, be closed to me. Moreover, whatever may
have been his purpose in coming here and in watching this place (and I
still suspect that he intends, or intended, to kidnap your brother), it
is likely that that purpose he has for the present dropped. In fact,
after so narrowly escaping capture here at the hands of the police,
this house--for some time, at least--he is likely carefully to avoid.
So even that clue is 'off.'"

"I'm very glad to hear it," was her reply. "Yes, what is it, Metcalfe?
Do you want me?"

"If you please, m'm," answered Metcalfe, who had opened the door while
Miss Clara was speaking, and was standing in an apologetic way with one
hand on the handle. "I knocked twice, but you were talking and didn't
hear me," he went on. "Miss Kate sent me. She'd like a word with you at
once, please, and before Mr. Rissler goes."

"All right--I'll come."

Then, Metcalfe having made his bow and gone, she turned to me:

"You'll find the _Times_ there on the table. I shan't be away long."

But she was away long--so long, indeed, that she did not return at all.
For almost an hour I was left alone, and then the door opened a few
inches, and instead of Miss Clara, Kate slipped quickly in.

Closing it, but with one hand still holding the handle, she faced me.
She looked deadly pale, and trembled violently.

"Mr. Rissler," she said, "my aunt tells me that you have promised her
what you refused to promise me--that you will in future abandon the
dangerous and not altogether creditable line of work you have taken up
in constituting yourself a detective. Is that so?"

"That is so," I answered hotly; "but in regard to its being a
discreditable occupation, and in regard to my having promised Miss
Carleton what I would not promise to you, I must protest----"

"Forgive me," she said coldly, "but I cannot argue the matter, or
listen to any explanation or protestation. I have come here to ask
you--to bid you--for my aunt, as well as for myself, to leave this
house instantly, and never, under any circumstances, to enter it
again."



KATE'S CONFESSION.


"I will give no such promise," I began furiously. "I will----"

Then I stopped short.

"Forgive me. I have some decent instincts left, I hope--in spite of my
being a detective," I added bitterly. "You are, of course, within your
rights; and if you so command, I have no option but to obey. But even
you cannot command me or compel me to cease from loving you. Am I to
have no explanation?"

"You are to have no explanation," she repeated in a dull, dreamy voice,
as if her thoughts were elsewhere, and with her eyes fixed on a far-off
space of sky which she could see through the window.

"Except, perhaps--you have already said it--it is because you hate me,"
I prompted bitterly.

Moveless as a listening sleep-walker, she made answer:

"It is _not_ because I hate you."

"Do you, or do you not, hate me?" I pleaded.

And again, dully, indifferently, like one speaking in her sleep, she
replied:

"I do _not_ hate you."

"But you dislike me," I urged.

With the same troubled, far-off look in her beautiful eyes, she
repeated, automatically:

"I do _not_ dislike you."

For a moment, like the defiant fluttering of a banner over a besieged
and well-nigh surrendered city, Hope sprang up to raise her red
flag upon the ramparts of my heart; but at the sight of the dull
indifference in the girl's eyes, banner and banner-bearer sank back.

"Perhaps even," I said in a foolish and feeble spirit of attempted
irony, "perhaps even you like me."

"Perhaps even," she echoed, "I like you."

"Kate," I cried, all the blood in my veins running riot, "it is
not possible--for God's sake don't play with me--but it is not
possible--tell me--it is not possible, it can't be--that--that--you
care."

In a moment she was alive again. Her eyes, all her soul in them, left
the far-off skies, and leapt to meet mine.

"I care," she said, softly.

The next instant, and before I could stay her, she was gone.

       *       *       *       *       *

It is fortunate I did not see Miss Clara as I left the house. Had I
met that dear creature on my way out, I should, to a dead certainty,
not only have kissed her on the spot, but with never a thought for
horrified servants or scandalised neighbours, should have put my arm
around her capacious waist, and then and there have compelled her
to dance a Highland fling with me. That Metcalfe thought I had been
drinking (as I had--deep draughts of the most intoxicating of all
elixirs, the elixir of love), I am positive. Detecting me in the act
of tweaking the nose of the stone bust of a celebrated Nonconformist
divine, which stood in a recess at the bottom of the stairs, and of
painstakingly (mere absence of mind that!) wiping my boots on the
doormat, as if I were about to enter a drawing-room instead of passing
out into a muddy street, he inquired solicitously whether I wouldn't
like a cab, remarking with a surreptitious glance at the boots with
which I had been performing such unnecessary antics on the doormat:

"Yes, sir; the streets _is_ very muddy, but you'll get home nice and
dry and comfortable in a keb."

Telling him that I was tired out and half asleep from my long watch
overnight, and that to walk home would be the surest way to awaken and
freshen me, I slipped a sovereign into his palm, and made my way into
the streets, all the blood in my body dancing in my veins, all the joy
of first love singing in my brain.

At my rooms I found the expected notice requiring me to attend and
to give evidence at the inquest to be held that day at noon upon the
bodies of the three men who had been found drowned in the Thames.

That the inquiry was not wanting in painful interest the reader will
readily surmise, but except to say that I was subjected to a severe
and suspicious examination, I do not propose further to enter upon the
details of the inquest here.

I come now to a point in my narrative when the trend of events takes
a new turn, and when I shall have to relate happenings of infinitely
greater importance than the circumstances under which Parker and
Smudgy, the negro Black Sam, and the two Grants, met their death.
These were but the "curtain-raisers" preceding the drama in which the
man known to the readers of this history as "the Dumpling" took so
remarkable a part. Up to this point my tale--I had to tell it as it
happened--has been little more than a detective story. Now we shall
soon come to a story of quite another sort.



I DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF THE DUMPLING.


The inquest over--for two mortal days I was kept hanging about
Southend, to the mortuary of which the bodies had been taken--I
returned to town, eager to see Kate, and to compel from her dear
lips a second sweet admission that I was not without a place in her
heart. Something there was in the look of the house--the drawn blinds
of the reception rooms, the fact that, except for the hall and the
basement, the place was in darkness--which turned me cold and sick with
apprehension and with a sense of coming evil.

"Good evening, Metcalfe," I said, when the door was opened by that
worthy. "Are the ladies in?--Miss Carleton, or Miss Kate?"

"No, sir," he said, looking at me queerly. "They have left town, but
there's a letter--two letters--for you, sir. If you'll come in I'll get
them."

"Left town?" I said, blankly. Then, recovering myself--for I did not
desire to enliven the _ennui_ of Metcalfe and his fellow-servants by
providing them with matter for speculation and discussion concerning
the relations which existed between their young mistress and myself--I
added, unconcernedly:

"Oh, yes--of course. I had forgotten it was to be so soon, and I have
been out of town myself. Where are the letters, Metcalfe?"

"On the library table, sir. Perhaps you'll walk in. Can I get you some
coffee, sir?"

"No, thank you. I'm just up from the country, and haven't dined. But
I'll go into the library to read my letters. If any answer should
happen to be wanted, I could write it there, and so catch an early
post. I shan't want you any more, Metcalfe. Don't wait."

The man withdrew, and I opened the first of my letters.

It was from Kate.

 Good-bye, dear Max; good-bye for ever. Something horrible has
 happened, and you and I must never see each other again. So we have
 gone--my aunt and I. It was the only way. If you love me, do not
 try to find us. It will be quite useless. If you love me, keep your
 promise--the promise, I mean, that you refused to me. You will not
 refuse it to me now, I know--the first and last promise I shall ever
 ask from you. One thing more, only, I will ask you--not to promise,
 but to believe; and that is that the answer I gave to your last
 question, as we stood together by the window, was true.--KATE.

I suppose it was because I had opened it, prepared for some shock,
some calamity, that I read this letter with such calmness, such
impassiveness. Instead of springing up to stride the room, like one
beside himself, instead of gasping "Gone!--and for ever! My God! What
can it mean?" I rose quietly from my chair, and, thrusting the letter
into my pocket, walked over leisurely to stir the fire. That there
was an obstacle of some sort between Kate and me, I had realised
the last time she and I had stood in this same room together, and
she had confessed her love. But bogeys--most of all the bogeys of a
woman's making and imagining, paralyse and appal her as they may--do
not greatly alarm the average man. That which she pronounces to be
an insurmountable obstacle, he first surveys on all sides to satisfy
himself that it is an obstacle at all, and then calmly goes to work to
discover how that obstacle can best be overcome. Kate loved me; I loved
her. Given these facts, I saw no reason to despair.

So, as I say, instead of indulging in the usual heroics with
which--when the heroine by word of mouth, or by letter, informs the
hero that there is some occult reason why she "can never be his"--we
are all familiar in the pages of a novel, or on the stage, I merely
stirred the fire meditatively.

"Now for Miss Clara's epistle," I said, opening the second letter. "Let
us see if _she_ can throw any light on the mystery."

 MY DEAR BOY (it ran),--I have some very bad news for you. I kept it to
 myself while you were telling us your adventures the other morning,
 for I did not want to upset you, until the actual necessity for
 action had come. It concerns myself and Clara, very nearly and very
 terribly--how nearly and how terribly Clara does not know, for I wish
 to spare her as much pain as I can. All the time you and she and I
 were together that morning I knew, though she and you did not, that it
 would be our last meeting for, perhaps, a long time. During that time
 it will be a great relief to Clara and to me to be assured of your
 personal safety; and that you are safe--so long as you are engaged in
 detective work--neither she nor I can ever be sure. In all probability
 you noticed that before leaving you and Clara together, I took her
 aside for a moment to give her some instructions. These instructions
 were that she was to use all her influence to get you to promise to
 abandon the dangerous pursuit in which you are engaged, and to devote
 yourself instead to novel-writing. As Clara failed to obtain such a
 promise, I returned, to see if I could not obtain that promise myself.
 You were very good to me. You always have been good to me, and gave
 me the required promise at once. I am very grateful, my dear boy, for
 that and for all the consideration and affection you have shown to an
 ugly old woman.

 Then I went back to Clara and told her that for the present she
 and you must not meet again. I did not tell her the truth; for the
 truth--of which she has no suspicion--is too horrible to tell. All
 she knows is that something terrible has happened, and that for some
 time--whether long or short I cannot now say--you and she must not
 meet again. Knowing me and my affection for you as you do, you will
 realise that I should not say this were the necessity not absolute and
 imperative. Please God, all will come right one day. Good-bye, my dear
 boy. God bless you. Your affectionate and faithful friend,--C.C.

As I read this extraordinary letter, the explanation of Miss Clara's
and Kate's inexplicable attitude came to me in a flash. Dolt,
blockhead, addle-brained idiot that I was! I--a detective! It was
well for me--it was high time, indeed--that I had decided to give up
detective work. Fool that I was not to have seen it before!

The Dumpling and Kate's father, the elder Miss Carleton's brother, were
one and the same man!



JOHN CARLETON'S DOUBLE.


That Kate and her aunt were now aware of the identity of John Carleton
with the Dumpling, I was absolutely sure. I could point back, even,
to the moment when--to the latter, at least--the suspicion which
afterwards became certainty was first aroused.

It was when I was repeating, word for word, as they had fallen from
his lips, the Dumpling's expressions about the poor, that the first
sign of agitation had been noticeable in the elder woman. Then, when I
went on to speak of his mania in regard to his being none other than
Napoleon--then it was, as I clearly remembered, that the self-possessed
and by no means impressionable Miss Clara had astonished and alarmed me
by looking as if she were about to faint.

Doubtless she had heard him say the same thing before and in the same
words, and so had no difficulty in identifying the speaker as her
brother.

Kate, on the contrary, had apparently heard me out without connecting
her father with the Dumpling. She had shown no sign of dismay or
agitation, while listening to my story, and when her aunt had called
her aside, at its conclusion, and had urged her to obtain from me the
promise to give up my detective work, Kate had undertaken the task
somewhat light-heartedly, as witness the episode of the uneclipsed eye.

It must have been after Kate had left me, that the elder woman had
spoken of some great and impending danger. How much of the truth she
had told her niece I did not know; but when the poor girl returned
alone to speak to me, she seemed visibly aged, and was trembling in
every limb. Then it was that, by her aunt's command, she forbade me
ever again to enter the house. Were I to do so, John Carleton and I
must sooner or later come face to face, and that I should be the means
of arresting--perhaps of bringing to the gallows--the father of the
girl I loved, was too horrible to contemplate.

Of all conceivable happenings, nothing could so irretrievably part
Kate and myself for ever as that, whereas could Miss Clara contrive
to obtain a medical certificate, to the effect that her brother was of
unsound mind, and have him put under restraint, the further committal
of crimes by him would effectively be prevented, and Carleton, once out
of the way, Kate and I might come together again. That, I believed,
was the end for which Miss Clara was working, and as it was an end
which would spare Kate from being publicly branded as the daughter of a
madman and a murderer, I could not but feel myself in sympathy with it.

That John Carleton and the Dumpling were one and the same man, there
was no room for doubt. That fact explained everything. That was why
Mr. John Carleton had absented himself unexpectedly from his home, and
caused thereby some anxiety to his sister and daughter. He had intended
no doubt to return thither, after superintending the carrying out of
the projected kidnapping operation--instead of which my unexpected
appearance, and subsequent escape from the opium den, had compelled
him to devote himself to the clearing out of the bombs, chemicals, and
other contents of the place, before the arrival of the police. The
telegram from Glasgow was, of course, a fake. He might have instructed
some accomplice of his to despatch a telegram from that place, or the
whole thing, post-mark and all, might have been a forgery.

Which of the two suppositions was true I did not greatly care. It was
enough for me to know that in discovering the reason for Mr. John
Carleton's non-return to his family that night, I had discovered also
the reason for several of his subsequent acts. I had discovered, for
instance, his reason for watching No. 5, Taunton Square, not, as in my
anxiety to form a theory of some sort, I had supposed--because one of
the millionaires whom he was scheming to kidnap, and to hold to ransom,
lived there, but because that house was his home, and because, before
returning to its shelter, he wished to satisfy himself that all was
secure, and that no police trap had been set for him. It was because
the house was his own that he had taken shelter in the garden after the
murder of young Grant. A hiding-place of some sort it was necessary
speedily to find, for the police were everywhere on the watch; and once
he could obtain entrance to his own house he would be safe. Nor would
that entrance be difficult to obtain. None knew better than he that,
by the breaking of a certain pane of glass in the conservatory, he
would be able to shoot back the bolt on the conservatory door; and but
for my accidental presence, he would in all probability have effected
undisturbed the purpose at which he aimed.

He had, no doubt, done his best to deaden the noise he made in breaking
the glass; and, far away as the conservatory was from the living
rooms and from the servants' quarters, the sound would have passed
unheeded but for my abnormally acute sense of hearing. Even if it
had been heard, and had Metcalfe or Miss Clara hurried thither, some
plausible story of his having been accidentally shut out, or other
explanation, would have been forthcoming, and no one was likely to give
a respectable householder in charge for forcing his way into his own
residence, or to connect the fact of his doing so with a recent murder.

That was why, having failed in the first attempt, he had returned, at
dead of night--to discover me emerging from the wine cellar. That was
why he knew there was a gas-jet laid on there, though he had tried to
explain away his knowledge of the fact, and had done his best to throw
dust in my eyes, by telling me that he made it a rule never to enter a
place without finding out all he could about it beforehand.

I could have kicked myself for my density in not having seen daylight
before, but the possibility of connecting my lovely Lady of the Lake
and her eminently respectable, if somewhat unconventional, aunt with a
criminal of the Dumpling type, was so unthinkable that I may, perhaps,
be forgiven for not having entertained it until it was thus forced upon
me.

Of one thing I was certain--that whatever the explanation, the good
faith of Kate and Miss Clara was above suspicion. Unknown to them, the
man was leading a double life. They may, perhaps, have wondered at
his absences from home, and at his trouble in contriving a pretended
burglar alarm, which, I had little doubt, had been invented for quite
another purpose than was pretended. The fact that he had fitted up a
police call for protection against burglars, seemed to point to him
as a reputable member of society and a person of means. No doubt,
when he was absent from home, the use to which the thing was put was
actually that of a burglar alarm. But when he was at home, I thought
it more than possible that he would be at the trouble of making a
disconnection (it could be done by the turning of a switch) between his
house and the police station, and that in cases of emergency--as, for
instance, a surprise visit by the police--the so-called burglar alarm
could as effectively be used against the officers of the law as against
burglars. The simultaneous locking of all doors and windows must
necessarily delay the entrance of the officers who had come to arrest
him, and in the meantime Mr. Carleton would no doubt be making good his
escape by some secret means of exit, known only to himself.

That his sister and his daughter and possibly his servants were his
dupes, and in no sense his accomplices, I was absolutely convinced. But
dupes his sister and daughter could be no more. They, at least, knew
something of the truth, if not the whole of it. Hence their letters to
me; hence their endeavours to induce me to give up Dumpling hunting and
detective work; and hence their disappearance. And now that I, too,
knew the truth, later though my knowledge might be, I was confronted
with the question, "How, in view of what you know, do you propose to
act?"



"ONLY STARVING!"


Given the fact that I had promised to refrain from further detective
work, the fact that the two Miss Carletons had disappeared and had
forbidden me to try to find or to follow them, "How did I now propose
to act?" was the question before me.

It was answered next morning as I sat at breakfast.

Opening my newspaper, I read that, owing to the removal of the works
of two of the greatest ship-building firms from Thames Side to the
North, thousands of men had been thrown out of work, and the greatest
destitution prevailed. "The condition of things in East London"--so
it was stated in the newspaper--"is more terrible than has been known
within the memory of anyone now alive, and it is no exaggeration to say
that at this moment hundreds, if not thousands, of women and children
are starving." Some instances which had come under the personal notice
of the writer of the article were then given. Even to read them was
painful; to try to realise them was heart-breaking.

"This may, or may not, be a piece of newspaper exaggeration, for the
purpose of sensationalism," I said; "but if the half of what this man
says be true, what right have I to be sitting here before a comfortable
breakfast while little children are crying vainly for bread?"

I pushed my almost untasted breakfast away from me. I felt as if, with
the wail of starving children in my ears, another mouthful of food
would choke me.

"I can, of course, sit down and send a cheque to a church fund for
the unemployed or to a charitable institution," I went on, "and in
the majority of cases that is the wisest and best course to pursue.
Organisation, especially expert organisation, can make even a small
sum go further than can any amount of inexpert individual effort; in
addition to which, nine out of ten of the people who happen to be
charitably disposed are unable, for various reasons, to distribute
their charity at first hand, and in person. I don't know that it
is always desirable that they should do so. Their very kindness
of heart makes them easy to be imposed upon; and promiscuous and
amateur almsgiving is, I fear, often responsible for the springing
up of a class of anything but amateur alms-cadgers and spongers.
But I know the 'ins' and 'outs' of the East End of London. I'm not
altogether unacquainted with the fact that the greater the need, the
more pitiful and deserving the case, the harder is it to find. Your
decent, deserving, hard-working man, whom ill-health and misfortune
have brought to want, will creep away secretly to starve, in silence
to suffer and to die, while your rascally loafer, who has never done
an honest day's work in his life, seizes upon every opportunity of
'times being bad,' or of men being known to be out of work, to parade
the streets, hymn-howling and copper-cadging for the wherewithal to
spend in the public-house. I know something of the ways and wiles of
gentlemen of this kidney, something of the silent suffering and dogged,
splendid pride of the other class; and being myself, for the present,
at least, a genuine member of the unemployed, and having, moreover, a
system of my own invention for getting at the facts, I think I'll go
east and investigate things for myself. For novel writing or other
literary work my mind is just now too unsettled, and as I am not one
who can for any length of time remain inactive, I will make the start
this morning and this moment, and be off."

Taking the train to Shadwell, I deliberately set to work to find the
most squalid and poverty-stricken slum in the whole district. Then I
entered the nearest baker's shop.

It is curious how readily the poor sum up a new comer. The slatternly
but not unkindly-looking woman who popped out from a back room saw at
a glance that I had not called in the usual course of business, and
as she came forward, her foolish, expressionless face lost something
of its normal vacancy, until her vague eyes, indeterminate nose, open
mouth and dropped chin, seemed for all the world to shape themselves
into a human note of interrogation.

"Yes, sir?" she inquired respectfully, with a slight inclination.

"Good morning," I said, with an effort to make voice, manner, and
expression as pleasant as possible. "Good morning. I hope I haven't
disturbed you. I'm not a customer--for the present, at all events."

"No, sir?" she replied, in a non-committal interrogative tone of voice,
which implied, though it left unspoken, the question, "Now I wonder
what in the world he wants?"

"It's this way," I went on. "I have been reading in my paper (I live
in quite another part of London, by the bye) that there are hundreds,
thousands even, of women and children starving out this way. Well,
now, I don't accept for gospel truth everything I read in the papers,
but it seemed to me that if I came out for myself to a place like
Shadwell, found a poor street like this, and made my way to the nearest
shop--which happens to be yours--anyone like yourself could tell me
something of the real facts of the case. It seems to me, too, that if
you would be so good as to help me--which I'm sure you will--you could
put me in the way of getting at the genuine, the deserving cases. I
mean the cases which, perhaps because the people in question don't
attend any particular church, and so, not having their names on the
visiting list, get overlooked by the clergy and ministers who are
doing such splendid work; as well as the cases where, perhaps because
of a pride, to which I take off my hat, the sufferers can't humble
themselves to beg or to apply for parish relief.

"Understand me, please. I don't come from any newspaper. I'm not
working in connection with any charity, or any church, and I haven't
very much money to spend. But if women and children are really
starving, as I read in the newspapers, I want to do what little I can
to help. Do you know of any such cases?"

"The last customer I served before you came in, sir, was a woman," she
made answer. "I served her with a farthing's-worth of bread. That's all
she and her three children have for to-day."

The unemotional, matter-of-fact way in which she spoke was infinitely
more significant than if she had put the point of exclamation to her
statement by any melodramatic show of feeling, any play of features, or
gestures of hands.

"But such cases are not common!" I protested.

"No," she said dully. "They're not. It's much commoner not to have the
farthing's-worth of bread."

"Would you mind giving me that poor woman's name and address? I pledge
you my word," I added, perhaps unnecessarily, "that I'll say no word to
hurt her pride or wound her feelings."

"18, Cripps Court," was the reply; "and her name's Frost. But there's
five families living in the house, most of 'em in one room, and two of
them are Frost. The one you want is Mrs. Fred Frost."

"Thank you very much. It is very good of you to take this trouble," I
said. "Are there any other cases equally bad that you know? If so, I'd
be grateful to be told of them."

"Lots," was the laconic reply. "I can give you enough names, without
your going out of this street, to keep you busy for a week. There's a
couple at No. 9, in the top room. They've pawned every stick they've
got, and are sleeping on bare boards on the floor. I know they haven't
had anything to eat for two days. But you won't want anything to do
with them, I expect. The man's a thief by trade, and the woman--well,
she's worse, and I know for certain they ain't husband and wife."

"I don't care what they are," I replied hotly. "They're
fellow-creatures, made of the same flesh and blood as we are, and
they're in want. What name shall I ask for them by?"

"Lowe," she said. "That's the name they go by, anyway."

Thanking the good woman behind the counter for her help, I set out to
find Mrs. Fred Frost.

The door of No. 18, Cripps Court, was opened by a wan, haggard-looking
woman, whom the summons had apparently disturbed in the act of suckling
a sickly-looking baby, which she held on one arm, while the hand of her
other arm was fumbling at the unbuttoned bosom of her dress.

"Good morning," I said, raising my hat. "Can you tell me, please, if
Mrs. Fred Frost is in?"

"No, sir, she's not," she answered civilly; "her baby's dead, and she's
gone to find her husband, who's trying to get a job at the docks."

"Oh! Poor woman! I'm very sorry!" I said, gently. "The fact is, her
name has been given me as one whose husband is out of work, and I
ventured to call to see if she'd allow me to send in some groceries,
and other things by way of being of some small assistance during the
hard time. If you'll allow me, I'll call again."

"She'll be very grateful to you, sir, I'm sure," the woman replied.
"Having the child ill has made it very hard for her just lately."

"Is there anybody else living here with whom things are going badly? If
so, perhaps you'd tell me! I can't do very much, but what I can do, in
the way of sending in some tea and some meat and a few groceries, I'd
be very glad to."

"Well, sir," answered the woman, "there's an old couple in the back
room, living alone with their little grandson (the child's father and
mother are dead). But they've gone out--all three of them--to try and
get a relief ticket somewhere. If you were to ask for them when you
come back to see Mrs. Frost, you'll see for yourself by the very look
of them how things are. The little boy--he's all right. They've managed
it, though I don't know how, between them, 'cept by starving themselves
to give to him, for skin and bone is about all that's left of the two
old people."

"I'm very much obliged to you," I said. "And I shall venture, as I say,
to call in again, perhaps in an hour's time. Good morning."

"Good morning, sir, and thank you," she said quietly.

As I was turning away the sun, which had not before been visible that
morning, suddenly broke out from behind the clouds. Standing, as she
had been, in a dark passage, and partly behind the half-opened door,
she was so much in the shadow that I could not observe her closely;
nor, for the matter of that, had I tried to do so, being anxious not to
seem curious or inquisitive. But as the sun fell full upon her face,
and I marked the hollows in her cheeks, and the dark rings around her
eyes, I stopped suddenly, impulsively.

"Please don't think me impertinent," I said. "But you look far from
strong yourself. I hope--I do hope--your husband isn't out of work,
too."

"Yes, sir; he's been out five weeks now, come Tuesday."

"And have you any children? Again I ask you to forgive me."

"There's no offence, sir," she said quietly, but I saw that she was
trying hard to stay the trembling of her lips.

"Yes, sir, I've five, and--and--there's been no food in the house since
yesterday."

"Yet you never asked help for yourself!" I said, gentle reproach
perhaps in my voice, but wonder and reverence at my heart. "You are a
brave woman, a true woman, and I honour and respect you. But, for the
children's sake, you mustn't refuse, if I ask you to let me try to be
of some little help while the hard time lasts."

She was sobbing piteously now--more, I suspect, because she was faint
and weak and in want of food than for any other reason.

"I'm sure I've--I've--I've tried hard to get some work, and so's Joe."

Then she pulled herself together.

"Will you come in, sir?"

Uncovering, I followed her into the wall-bare room. I say wall-bare
advisedly, for, except for an old box in the corner, every stick of
furniture had, as I discovered, been pawned or sold for food. Yet here
seven of my fellow-creatures, made in the image of God, were herded
together, within the space of a few square feet.

A wan, ragged, and unkempt man was sitting on the upturned box, his
elbows on his knees, his hands thrust in the hair that was bushed over
his ears.

He leapt up morosely, savagely, at my entrance, and muttered something
about "More ---- spies!"

But I was not born an Irishman for nothing. Three minutes had not
passed before I had won him to friendliness; five minutes had not
gone by before the youngest child was sitting on my knee, listening,
open-mouthed, to stories about a performing dog.

After a little time I said:

"Now I wonder if Timmy there--he's nine, you said, Mrs. Wright--I
wonder whether he's a good hand at shopping, and if he'd come with
me to get a few things at the butcher's, and the baker's, and the
grocer's, and then help me to bring them back? Do you know, Timmy, I'm
a very, very greedy man, and want a cup of tea badly; and somehow I've
got an idea that your mother, here, is a good hand at making tea; and
when you and I come back, I'm going to beg her to be so very kind as to
make me a cup, and then, while all the rest of you have a cup too, and
something to eat with it, I'll finish that story of mine about the dog."

But I had miscalculated Timmy's strength. He and I stopped at the
first shop we came to--a grocer's--and borrowed a wicker basket. It
had the word "Margarine" stencilled or painted in big black letters on
one side; and by the same token, as, for weeks to come, I had occasion
to borrow that same basket, and came to be a familiar figure in the
streets, I was known and spoken of in the district as "Mr. Margarine."
Into this basket Timmy and I stacked away tea, sugar, butter, and other
groceries. Then we returned to my friend the woman in the baker's shop,
and added to our store a loaf or two of bread.

"And now, Timmy," I said, "I daresay this kind lady could find you a
piece of cake and a glass of milk. Meanwhile, I'll run across the road
and interview the butcher."

I had hardly entered the butcher's shop before I heard the sudden
pulling up of a horse and cart in the street, and saw the driver
hastily dismounting.

Timmy, supposing I had meant him to follow at once with the basket,
had taken it up, and must have passed out almost at my heels. Half-way
across the street he had suddenly reeled and fallen, and now lay white
and unconscious.

"What's the matter?" I asked the woman who was kneeling beside him with
his head on her arm.

"Oh, nothing!" she answered, bitterly. "You've got eyes in your head,
haven't you, and can see for yourself? He's fainted for want of
food--that's what's the matter. He's only starving!"



RE-ENTER THE DUMPLING.


"He's only starving!" the woman had said. But as I stooped to lift the
frail little figure from the ground, as I hurried with it across the
street and into the baker's shop, there to wet the white lips with a
restorative--a prayer that was like the spurting of blood from a wound,
a prayer that shot a pang of actual physical pain to my heart--so
poignant, so terrible was my remorse--surged up unuttered but not
unheard, within me.

"Lord Christ, lover of little children, spare and heal this Thy
stricken little child. Forgive and pardon such as I, who, living our
selfish, easeful lives, have closed our ears and shut our eyes to the
suffering and the misery around us. Help us to repent. Lash us, if need
be, with Thy whip of pain, burn us, if it seem good to Thee, with the
scorching of fire, but awaken us, arouse us, thaw this cruel, frozen
heart within us, that we be forgetful of the sufferings of these our
fellow-creatures no more. Amen."

And the prayer was heard--as every prayer that is uttered in earnest
is heard--on high. The restorative did its work. The cup of warm milk,
which--perhaps with a thought of Him who said, "And whosoever shall
give to drink one of these little ones a cup of cold water only ...
shall in no wise lose his reward"--was held to his lips by the good
woman, put new life into him; and before long Timmy and I were able to
gather together our belongings, and to return to No. 18, Cripps Court.

There, his mother brewing the tea, and the rest of the household
sitting around discussing the contents of my basket, I made the
happiest meal of my life. The Wright family were equally happy, and
listened to the continuation of my story of the performing dog with
uproarious laughter.

The mere fact that one, not in their own station of life, could, by
coming among them as one of themselves--asking no questions, laying
down no laws, but by talking to the children, taking the little
ones upon his knee, to show his watch or the dog's head on his
walking-stick--so please and delight them, was to me tragic.

The good fellowship, the realisation of the common bond of human
sympathy which--whether they wear corduroy or broadcloth, silk hats
or coster caps, satin gown or cotton frock--should bind men and women
together, seemed to cheer them in spirit as much, if not more, than
their bodies had been cheered by the food.

After a time Mrs. Wright departed, taking the children with her, to
execute some shopping commissions for me, and then Wright and I settled
down for a chat.

It was not long before I learned his reason for fearing, when I had
first entered, that I was what he had called "another of the ----
spies."

"It's this way, sir," he said. "Two ladies called afore you come. The
missis was out, or she wouldn't have let 'em in, but they came in
without bein' asked, and sat down--at least, one on 'em did--on this
box, and the other, she walked all around the place, sniffing like to
herself, and talking aloud about what she called the 'dirt.'

"'So your name's Wright, and you're out of work, are you?' says the
sitting-down one to me.

"'Yes,' I says, short like.

"'And what church do you attend?'

"'I don't attend none,' I says. 'The missis she goes sometimes of a
Sunday evening, and the kids goes to Sunday school.'

"'And wot church does your wife go to--and what Sunday school do the
children attend?' puts in the other lady, having done all the sniffing
round she could.

"'Wesleyan,' I says.

"'H'm!' she says. 'Dissenters! That's bad! Don't you and your wife
know that the Church of England is the Established Church of the land,
and that it's displeasing to Almighty God--not to say anything about
your wife's duty--in letting the children attend a sectarian place of
worship?'

"'No,' I says; 'I don't.'

"'And what wages do you earn when you're in work, Wright?' she says.

"'Well,' I says, 'when I was a farm labourer I only made thirteen bob
a week, but since I come to town I got about eighteen shillings when I
was in work.'

"'And how much did you save out of that?'

"'Why, nothink,' I said. 'I 'ad a 'ouse then, and the rent was eight
and six a week; and nine and six don't go far to feed and clothe five.'

"'Nonsense!' she says. 'You should always put by a percentage of
what you earn, no matter how small it is, against a rainy day. The
improvidence, the thriftlessness, of you poor is criminal! I'm afraid
you're an idle, worthless fellow, Wright,' she says, 'and not deserving
of any help until I see that you've reformed your ways.'"

Then, moved perhaps by the memory of his recent privations, he suddenly
seemed to lose all self-control. Springing to his feet, he shook his
clenched fist in the air, as with flaming face and voice hoarse with
frenzy, he shouted:

"Reform my ways? Idle, worthless fellow, am I? Ah! but the days of
grinding us down are gone. The days of them that oppress the poor are
over! It's Labour that's going to lord it now, and make the laws,
and rule the land. The millions on millions who starve and sweat and
labour are no longer to be the toys and tools of the few thousands that
sweat them, so that the idle few may live on the fat of the land. The
millions have found their leader at last--the man to organise them into
armies, and to lay the mines of the revolution that's close at hand,
the man that's----"

"Cease your ranting!" I interrupted sternly, for his voice had risen
to a screech. "Do you want to arouse the neighbourhood? I've heard
all that stuff before, and from the lips of the man who first uttered
it--for you are not speaking your own words. You are only speaking
words that have been put into your mouth. Wrongs you have, no doubt,
but rant and rioting won't right them, and I tell you----"

I was not allowed to finish the sentence. Someone who had no doubt been
listening in the passage outside suddenly sprang in, and before I could
turn--for my back was to the door--had seized me so as to pin both my
arms to my sides.

I did not need to be told the name of my assailant, to see his face, or
to hear his voice. Only one man whom I had ever met had arms of such
gorilla-like length, of such giant strength.

It was the Dumpling!



MUTINY AND A MESMERIST.


"You noisy fool, Wright!" he said, still holding me in his iron grip.
"I heard you ranting in the street outside." Then, "Am I hurting you,
Mr. Rissler?" he asked.

Foolishly I opened my mouth to reply, but hardly had I done so before a
handkerchief was thrust between my lips, and stuffed the next instant
half-way down my throat.

"Now, Wright," he said, "you can tie his hands and feet while I hold
him. Do it so that the knot won't give, but carefully, so as not to
hurt him. Come along, my good man! You are very slow! Do as I bid you,
and be quick about it!"

Somewhat to my surprise, and more so, evidently, to the Dumpling's,
Wright refused point-blank.

"I won't," he said, not budging from where he stood. "The gentleman's
been kind to me and mine, and lift a hand against him I won't."

"Do as I bid you!" was the answer, in a voice that was almost a hiss.

"I won't," was the dogged reply.

The next jiffey I was lifted off my feet by the Dumpling's powerful
arms, and, before I knew what he was about, I was lying upon my back on
the floor, bewildered but unharmed.

Putting a knee upon my chest, and holding me down meanwhile with both
hands, he raised his head and looked Wright straight in the eyes.

For the space of a few seconds the fellow stood gaping at the Dumpling
as if fascinated. Then his eyes dulled to a fixed, foolish stare, and
finally the lids of them drooped and closed. He was mesmerised--that
fact was evident.

"Open your eyes," the Dumpling commanded.

Wright did so.

"Put your hand in my right-side pocket, and you'll find a strap."

Automatically the other obeyed.

"Strap his ankles securely. No; it is no use your struggling, Rissler,"
he went on, as, getting my feet against the wainscot for leverage, I
put all my strength into an effort to throw him off.

Then, looking over his shoulder, he inquired:

"Have you got that strap, Wright?"

"I have got the strap," the other replied mechanically.

"Then be ready to use it," said the Dumpling. "Slip it around his
ankles when I say 'Now'!"

Still holding me down with both hands, he suddenly straddled his
powerful knees open, as if they had been a pair of nut-crackers,
and the two legs of me--outside which his own legs now lay--the two
halves of a walnut. Then he closed his knees, clipping mine together
within them, as the pair of crackers might clip the shell; and though
I struggled with all my strength, for I was furious at finding myself
proved to be not only as a child in his hands, but as an infant upon
his knees--or between them--I knew, when I heard him say 'Now,' that I
was as neatly hobbled as any horse.

"It's a pity you put us and yourself to all this unnecessary trouble,"
he said philosophically. "Now, then, Wright, look in his pockets for a
handkerchief, and lash his wrists while I hold them together."

As he spoke, the five fingers of his right hand closed on my left hand,
as the talons of a pouncing hawk close upon a field-mouse.

Then, in spite of my futile efforts, he drew my left hand towards my
right, and suddenly spanning the two with the fingers of his single
hand, nonchalantly arranging the set of his collar with the other
meanwhile, he said:

"Now, Wright, just tie his wrists together, will you?" and once again
the mesmerised man did as he was bidden.

Rising, the Dumpling turned from me to Wright. Looking that worthy full
in the eyes, he said, in a low voice:

"You are awake."

"I am awake," repeated Wright, automatically, as his eyes, still fixed
in a stupid stare, turned sluggishly in their sockets, following his
master's movements.

Lifting his dropped left arm slightly, the Dumpling touched, with a
finger tip, the finger tips of the other's loosely open hand. Then he
put his right hand on Wright's shoulder, and with a gentle shake, said:

"Wake!"

Wright came to himself with a start, and looked foolishly around.

"What did you mean by disobeying me just now?" asked the Dumpling with
sudden fierceness.

"I'm sorry, sir; I never done it before, as you know, and I'm sorry
if I opened my mouth too wide and made a noise. Me and mine has gone
through hard times since you were here last. The money you left us
was finished nigh upon two weeks ago, and not knowing where you
was, and not being able to get any work, we've had nothing to eat.
This gentleman here has been very kind to us, and though I've never
disobeyed you before, sir, I couldn't lift hand against him, and that's
a fact."

The Dumpling seemed genuinely concerned.

"Has it been so bad as that with you, my poor fellow?" he said gravely.
"Humphreys shall answer to me for this. I had to be away, it's true,
but I left plenty of money with him for all requirements, and I
particularly told him that no one, who is in with us, should be allowed
to want.

"I'm glad my friend on the floor has been good to you," he continued.
"He's of the right stuff, and ought to be with us, Wright--will be with
us one day, I hope and believe. You needn't be anxious about him. I
don't mean to do him any harm. On the contrary, I want to do him a good
turn, if he'll let me. My reason for gagging him was because, when I
first came in, I thought you and he were quarrelling. One doesn't do
a man any serious amount of damage by sticking a piece of rag in his
mouth and tying him up for a half-hour. He, on the other hand, not
understanding the situation, and supposing himself to be in danger,
might have called out and brought the police about our ears. He'd be
sorry for it after, when he knew the facts, so we protected ourselves,
and protected him against himself, by taking the precaution of making
sure of him first. See?

"Well, now, I want to have a few words with the gentleman, and I can do
so better if he and I are alone. You stay outside the door meanwhile,
Wright, and see that no one comes in."

Wright gone, and the door closed and locked, the Dumpling turned to me.

"Now, Mr. Rissler, to finish our interrupted conversation of the other
night. But first of all about that gag. If I take it off, will you give
me your promise, your parole, not to call or cry out, or do anything to
bring outsiders in? Nod if you agree. Shake your head, if not."

I nodded.

"All right," he said. "But you'll be more comfortable sitting up, with
your back to the wall, than lying on the floor full length. See, I'll
prop you up that way, and now to take off the gag."

While he was doing so I was planning a little surprise for him. Up to
now he had, no doubt, for reasons of his own, been very careful to
conceal his name from me. He had, to be sure, declared himself to be
Napoleon, but Napoleon's present address is not to be found in any
directory available for the purpose.

That my theory of the identity of John Carleton, of No. 5, Taunton
Square, with the man whom I knew as the Dumpling was correct, I was,
in my own mind, entirely persuaded; but I was shy of theories, and
anxious to replace them by actual knowledge. I was curious, too, to see
what effect the fact that his real name was known to me would have
upon him. Would he admit it? Would he deny it? Would it arouse him to
anger or to fear? Means of knowing I had none, other than by putting
the matter to the test; so, no sooner was I sitting up, with the gag
removed, than I looked him straight in the face and shot my bolt.

"Well, and how are you, Mr. John Carleton?" I said.



THE MYSTERY OF THE THIRD MAN.


That my knowledge of his identity would come to him as a surprise, I
was tolerably sure; and, in springing it thus suddenly upon him, I
hoped to gather by his face, which I was watching narrowly meanwhile,
whether he were moved by anger or by dismay.

The result was a fiasco, a fizzle, an abject failure. Either he was the
most consummate of actors, or, as is more likely, I the most consummate
of fools; for he looked at me at first with bewilderment, and then with
amusement, and finally burst into a hearty laugh.

"So _that's_ who you think I am, is it?" he chuckled. "I saw by that
speaking countenance of yours that you were hatching an egg (you are an
Irishman, aren't you? so you won't mind my mixing my metaphors), but I
didn't expect so weird a fowl as this."

He took that morning's paper from his pocket, and holding it open
before me, pointed to a paragraph, which ran as follows:

"The freedom of the City of Carlisle will to-day, at noon, be conferred
upon Mr. John Carleton, the eminent inventor, who was born in that
city, and has devoted a large portion of the fortune he amassed in
America to improving the homes of the poor in the place of his birth.
Miss Clara Carleton and her niece, Miss Kate Carleton, have left 5,
Taunton Square, W., for Homburg, where Mr. Carleton will shortly join
them."

"I admit," commented the Dumpling ironically, "that the fact of Mr.
Carleton devoting a portion of his fortune to improving the homes
of the poor, points suspiciously to me. How are you to be sure, Mr.
Rissler, that I didn't send that paragraph myself to the newspaper,
in the expectation of meeting you here, and, by showing it to you, to
put you off the scent? And the portrait! Stop a minute--there is a
portrait. It's in another part of the paper. Ah! here it is."

The portrait, which was inscribed "John Carleton, Esq., the eminent
inventor and philanthropist," was that of a flat-foreheaded,
clean-shaven man, absolutely bald, and so shrunken and fleshless of
face as to seem all skin and bone. The striking resemblance to a skull,
caused by his singular fleshlessness, was heightened by the fact that
he wore huge glasses of great magnifying power, out of which his hollow
eyes loomed cavernously.

"It's like me, isn't it?" said the Dumpling. "But then _you_ are not
to be deceived by anything of that sort, are you? It may dupe the
police, but _you_ will see at a glance that that portrait is only
myself, cleverly got up to look like somebody else. And when you read
in to-morrow's papers an account of the ceremony at Carlisle--and, by
the bye," pulling out his watch, "it's just about taking place now--you
will say to yourself, 'What a thing it is to be a detective! Here's
all this hullaballoo about the conferring of the freedom of the City
of Carlisle upon Mr. John Carleton at noon yesterday; and all the time
_I_ could have told them--if they'd only asked me, which for some
inexplicable reason they didn't--that the real John Carleton was at 18,
Cripps Court, Shadwell.'"

Then the bantering tone died out of his voice.

"I've chaffed you a bit about the mistake, Mr. Rissler, but it was
a very natural mistake to fall into," he said. "My coming to No. 5,
Taunton Square, twice in a night, my shadowing it beforehand, my
knowing all about it--no, I can't see, as I say, that you are very much
to blame, after all. It is curious that you should have thought me to
be John Carleton when, if there is _one man_ in all the world with whom
I would not, for all the world can offer, change places, that _one_ man
is John Carleton.

"When I tell you the story of my life, as I hope I shall one day,
you will understand and appreciate--but not till then--my reason for
speaking as I do. But now to talk of other matters. You have thought
over what I said to you the other night?"

"I have," I answered.

"And you are going to throw in your lot with us?"

"No."

"Rissler," he said gravely, "don't compel me to kill you, as kill you I
must under certain circumstances. There is blood on my hands already,
and more blood on my hands there must, of necessity, be before my
work is done; but, of all men in the world, you are the one man whom I
am most anxious to spare. You must see for yourself that you know too
much, that you are too dangerous to be left at large, except as one of
us. I have shown my heart, my hopes, my dreams, to you, as I have shown
them to no other man. Can I do nothing, say nothing, to influence you?
You feel as I do about the poor, as witness the fact of what you have
done for Wright and his family. What moved you to do that? What brought
you here, in Wright's house, at all?"

He stopped, as if expecting an answer; so, briefly as possible, I told
him of the impression that had been made upon me by his words about the
poor, and that, for the time, at least, I had thrown up my detective
work, in order to devote myself to doing what lay in my power to
alleviate the sufferings of my fellow-creatures.

He was genuinely moved, and when he inquired how I came to know of
Wright, and I told him of my system of making inquiries at a small
shop, in the very poorest district, he put a hand upon my shoulder,
and said excitedly:

"Rissler, you have no choice in this matter. God has called you to the
task, and you may not say Him nay. It is only a question of time. Two
days--only two days ago, you were against us. You announced yourself
as my enemy, as one who was set upon hunting me down. Now you tell me
of your own accord--and I believe you--that you have abandoned this
ignoble work of hunting down a fellow-creature who, whether his methods
be right or wrong in your eyes, is at least consumed with a passionate
desire to spend and to sacrifice everything he has, life itself, if
necessary, to succour and to help the poor and the oppressed.

"Two days ago, Rissler, as I say, you were against us. To-day you are
against us no more. Two days ago you cared nothing for the sufferings
of the poor, you gave no thought to them. To-day you are here amongst
them, ministering to them with your own hand. If two days have wrought
this change in you, what change may not another two days work? Another
two days may see you working with us, one of us, leading the Labour
hosts in this battle of the Lord.

"Now, listen to me. I'll be frank with you, and tell you that from
the first moment I saw you something within me warned me to beware of
you, and cried out, 'Kill! kill! kill!' That night in the wine cellar,
to-day in this squalid room, I should, had I followed my impulses, have
strangled you without mercy, without remorse, and without a thought.
Why don't I kill you? Why do I spend time which I can't afford to
spend? Why do I run risks which I never ought to run, in talking to
you, in explaining things to you, in trying to persuade you to join us?

"I will tell you. It is because God has revealed to me that you are
destined to play a great part in the history of this rising. It was
by no chance that you came that night to the opium den. It was by no
chance, it was not entirely by your resourcefulness and skill, that you
escaped with your life. It was no chance which drew you to the house in
Taunton Square, no chance which sent you here to Cripps Court.

"The part you are to play, God has not yet revealed to me; but I will
tell you what I believe that part to be. The army I command may be
counted by many millions, but leader there is only one--myself. And
the battle--which shall be called Armageddon--the battle which shall
set Labour upon the throne as Lord and Ruler of this land--that battle
approaches, and in that battle I shall fall. If I fall, all falls,
unless God raise up a second in command who shall be the leader of the
people after I am gone. That leader I believe you are marked out to
be. That is why I dare not kill you; that is why I am going to do the
maddest thing a sane man ever did.

"Of my own will I set you free to go from here unharmed. As yet you
are not with us. As yet God has not made known His will to you. As
yet, though I have twice appealed to you to throw in your lot with
us, you have resisted my entreaty. But I am not dismayed. Once again
I shall come to you. Once again I shall appeal to you, and that third
time I shall give you such assured proof of the triumph of our cause,
that after that third time I shall need to appeal to you no more. The
victory will be won. Our cause, the people's cause, God's cause, you
will, on that third appeal, espouse. Of my own accord I set you free."

As he spoke these last words, he stooped to unfasten my bonds,
and, in doing so, looked me for a moment in the eyes. Once again a
dream-tableau seemed to shape itself before me.

I saw myself--as one might see another person--in some dark place
underground. By my side stood the Dumpling, and far back in the shadow
was another man.

In my dream I could not see the face of the third man. I could see
the Dumpling's face, and upon it was a look of fiendish triumph as he
pointed me to the third man. But I could see my own face, and on my own
face, as it was turned to the face of the third man, was such a look of
incredulous horror as, waking or dreaming, I shall never see upon human
face again.

Then the dream passed. I was free of my bonds, and the Dumpling was
holding open the door.

"Good-bye, Rissler!" he said. "We shall meet again and soon; and that
meeting will mean great things for both of us."

Without a word, without so much as a "Thank you" or a "Good day,"
I passed out, like one who walks in his sleep. I could think of
nothing save the unseen face of the third man in my dream, and of the
incredulous horror which had been upon my own face on realising who
that third man was.



FORTY MILES IN A PERAMBULATOR!


My discomfiture at the Dumpling's derisive repudiation of the
supposition that he was John Carleton was completed next morning, when
John Carleton himself returned to town, and John Carleton in the flesh
I with my own eyes several times saw, as he went in and out of his
house in Taunton Square.

"That man," said I to myself, "should be an object-lesson to you in
the futility of theory building. First, you called yourself a fool for
not having seen that John Carleton was the Dumpling, and the Dumpling,
John Carleton. Now, you have the pleasure of knowing yourself a
double-distilled donkey, for ever having supposed anything of the sort."

Upon the theory--the fact, as I had thought it to be--that John
Carleton and the Dumpling were one and the same man, rested the only
explanation I had to offer in regard to the letter I had received from
the two Miss Carletons, aunt and niece. That theory being now entirely
exploded, their extraordinary behaviour remained as much, if not more,
of a mystery than ever.

A mystery--so far as I was concerned--I decided that it might remain.
Of detective work and of theory building I had had more than enough,
and so I betook myself that very afternoon to Shadwell, to renew the
investigations which my meeting with the Dumpling had interrupted.

The first name on my list was that of a tailor's "hand," named Holmes,
a widower who, I was told, had five young children, and was out of
work. He was a consumptive-looking creature, hollow of cheek, eye, and
chest, and with a hacking cough.

"Yes, sir," he said civilly, in reply to my inquiries. "It is quite
true that I am out of work, and that I have children; but I can't take
your help, asking your pardon all the same, sir, for seeming rude and
ungrateful."

"On the contrary," I said, "it is I who have to apologise to you, Mr.
Holmes, for what you might very well think my impertinence in coming
here at all. But I happened to hear, quite by chance, how beautifully
you keep your children; and how nice they always look; and learning
that you were out of work, and being very, very fond of children (I
haven't any myself: I wish I had), I thought there wouldn't be any
harm, at least, in calling, just to see whether there were any little
thing I could do for you, until you're in work again. I'm a working
man, as you are, though I happen to work with a pen, while you happen
to work with a needle. And I'm a poor man, too, for the matter of that;
but just lately I chanced, by a stroke of luck, to make a pound or two
more than usual, and when I have a stroke of luck I like to share it
with someone who has been less lucky--just as I believe you'd be ready
to share your good luck, when it comes, with me, if I happened to need
it. But I respect your independence and pride, and I ask you again to
forgive me for calling."

"It isn't pride, sir," he said; "and, if the children were in absolute
want, I'd take your help and thank God for it. It's this way, sir. This
week we have just enough money left out of my savings to last us--me
and the children--in bread. It has only been bread, and dry bread, it's
true; and if when Monday comes I haven't got work, there won't even be
bread, for my money will be entirely gone. If you should be this way
then, and would look in, and I haven't found work, I will take your
help--putting it the way you do, sir--and thank God for it. But when
I know of hundreds of little children who haven't had even a piece of
bread for days, I can't take----But I thank you kindly. God bless you,
sir. I must go now. I hear one of the children calling. Good afternoon."

He closed the door in my face--not rudely, but in haste, lest I should
see how shaken he was by emotion; and bowing my head, and with my own
heart rising strangely in my throat, I turned away.

Just for the moment, I did not feel like facing the eyes in the street;
so, as a slight rain was falling, I took shelter in a dark passage
leading to a court, and stood there out of sight of passers, to collect
my thoughts.

It was not long before my attention was attracted by a curious sight.
A gipsy-like, wolf-faced man was wheeling a child's perambulator, in
which, to my astonishment, I saw curled up the figure of a full-grown
woman. I recognised the couple at a glance. Walking once along the
high road from Epping to London, I had seated myself upon a five-barred
gate by the wayside for a quiet smoke. The gate stood between thick
hedge-rows, and, as it was set back a little, the folk passing along
the road could not see me until they were almost level with the gate.
By and by I heard what struck me as a very pretty altercation between
a man and a woman who were approaching me slowly, but whom as yet I
could not see. The man, as I discovered when they came into sight, was
wheeling a perambulator (the same perambulator, in fact) in which were
a number of ferns and primrose roots that he was carrying to London to
sell. This perambulator the woman was pleading to be allowed to take a
turn at pushing, urging that as the man had been up since four in the
morning to gather the ferns and primroses, and had had to wheel the
perambulator five miles out and five miles back, he must consequently
be very tired. He, protesting that he was not tired at all, point-blank
refused, declaring that, as she had only just come out of hospital, she
must be much more tired than he. And so the petty quarrel continued,
until the pair came opposite to the gate, and I saw that she was a
sickly, blear-eyed, unlovely woman, and he an unkempt, gipsy-like
fellow with lean face and hungry, wolf's eyes.

Well, to cut a long story short, I had contrived to make their
acquaintance, and had found that, underneath their rags and dirt, beat
two honest and unselfish hearts. I had told them to come always to me
if in need of assistance of any sort--an invitation of which they took
advantage only once, and then when their straits were desperate. On
every other occasion I had found them touchily independent, and though
I sometimes bought flowers, bullrushes, mistletoe, or fern-roots from
them for the decoration of my house or garden, they would not accept a
farthing from me in the shape of charity. If I wished to buy the wares
they had for sale, that was another matter; and even then I have reason
to know that I got more flowers, bullrushes, or fern roots for sixpence
than their usual customers got for a shilling.

For some twelvemonth we continued the best of friends. Then suddenly
their visits ceased, and I set eyes on neither again until I saw the
pair of them at Shadwell--the woman curled up in the perambulator, and
the man pushing it.

"Nash!" I called out, running after them. "Nash, where _have_ you been
all this time? And why haven't you and Mrs. Nash been to see me?"

"We have been doing pretty much the same as usual, sir," he replied
stiffly; "and thank you for asking." Then touching his ragged cap, he
said brusquely, "Good day, sir," and, pushing the perambulator before
him, passed along.

But I was not thus easily to be shaken off. At first he stood very
much on his dignity, answering my questions, in regard to himself
and his doings, with civil but manifest unwillingness, but at last I
contrived--and then only with difficulty--to discover wherein I had
offended.

On the last occasion, when they had visited me, I had said to him, as
he was passing out: "Well, good-bye, Nash. Mind, if ever you get into
trouble, be sure to come or to send to me, and I'll do my best to get
you out."

By "trouble" I had meant illness, or the inability to scrape together
the small sum they paid as rent for the miserable hovel in which they
lived.

But in George Nash's world "trouble"--so I learned for the first
time--has only one meaning when applied to a man (the word is used in a
different sense in regard to a woman), and that meaning--jail.

"I don't see why you should have thought that of us, sir," Nash said
with quiet dignity. "Poor we may be, but at least we've managed to keep
honest. And the inside of a prison we're never likely to see. We thank
you kindly for what you've done for us, sir, the missis and me, but if
you think as we're that sort, well, sir, we've made a mistake about
you, and you've made a mistake about us, and we wish you good-day."

Turning doggedly to the perambulator, he touched his hat and passed on.

"Why, my dear fellow," I said hotly, following him, and taking him by
the hand, "such a thought never entered my head. I'd leave you--and for
the matter of that I _have_ left you or your wife--in my room alone
with every farthing I possess lying about openly, and never even dream
of counting it, or of thinking of it at all.

"Well," I went on, when I had at last persuaded him that he had done
me an injustice, "well, and what on earth is the meaning of Mrs. Nash
being cooped up in this perambulator? She looks very white and thin. I
do hope she isn't ill."

"Yes, sir; she's very ill," was the answer. "Got something wrong inside
her, the doctor said, that'll have to be cut out. I'm taking her to
Reading now."

"To Reading?" I said. "But why to Reading? I can easily arrange to get
her into a good hospital for women here."

"No, sir, thank you kindly. She's set on going to Reading, and nowhere
else. The doctor there (she's been there afore, you know) don't treat
poor folk as some other doctors do. They don't mean not to be kind, but
they speak so sharp, it frightens her. The doctor at Reading--ah! he is
different. She ain't a bit afraid of him. She won't go anywhere but to
Reading. She's set on it, sir, and so am I."

Knowing the man as I did, I could see that it was no use to argue with
him.

"I see," I said. "Quite right, George. I'll come with you as far as
Paddington, if you'll let me. Shadwell Station is some way yet. You
look hot and tired already, and so I'll take a turn at pushing the pram
while you rest. But if I may make a suggestion, I should say that the
best thing to do is to steer for the nearest place where we're likely
to find a four-wheeled cab and let me drive you to Paddington. How did
_you_ propose taking Mrs. Nash there?"

"Same way as I'm taking her to Reading, sir," he said unconcernedly;
"in the pram, of course."

"The pram!" I ejaculated. "My dear Nash, what nonsense! It's forty
miles! You can't wheel a grown woman forty miles in a child's
perambulator."

"Can't I, sir?" he said, smiling with an air of superiority. "I've
taken her there twice before in the perambulator, and by picking up a
bit of work on the way we've managed nicely."

Then he looked at me queerly.

"Mr. Rissler," he said in a low voice, "will you take a word from a man
as you've been a friend to, and as'd like to prove himself a friend
of yours? I can't answer no question, and I didn't ought to say what
I'm going to say. I know as you're the poor man's friend, though you
are one of the gentry. But there's them as don't know it; and, sir,
believe me, there's trouble ahead for the likes o' you--bitter trouble,
bloody trouble. You take my word for it. And this is what I want to
say to you, sir. When the trouble comes, if you should find yourself
among enemies, if you should find yourself in danger o' your life,
as'll happen to many like you afore long, just you throw up your left
arm with your fist closed, and say, 'God and Napoleon and the Dumpling
strike with a granite arm!'"

He looked furtively around him as if afraid of being overheard by
eavesdroppers, and then repeated the sentence, "'God and Napoleon and
the Dumpling strike with a granite arm!' That's the word, sir. Do you
think you can remember it?"

Inwardly amused at the seriousness with which the foolish fellow was
taking the Dumpling's rhodomontade, but hiding my amusement under a
face portentously grave, lest I should give my well-meaning friend
offence, I replied:

"Yes, I can remember it, and I'll be sure to bear your words in mind,
if necessity comes. Thank you very much, Nash."

But to myself I said:

"A grown woman! Wheeled forty miles in a perambulator to undergo an
operation! And for no other reason than that the doctor at Reading is
kind and doesn't speak sharp to the poor! My God!"



THE GREAT INSURRECTION BEGINS.


Looking back now upon the time of which I am writing, I cannot
altogether acquit myself of criminal negligence for failing to
realise--until it was too late to take action--how insidiously and how
thoroughly the Dumpling was doing his work. Nash's warning--though I
was by no means disposed to take it seriously--had not been altogether
a surprise to me, for I knew already that inflammatory speeches were
being delivered, inflammatory literature circulated broadcast. To
these I attached small importance, having too much faith in the common
sense and in the conservatism of my fellow-countrymen to believe that
the Dumpling could induce them to take concerted action upon any
considerable scale. I have since learned that secret meetings were
held nearly every night; but instead of one mass meeting, which must
inevitably have attracted the attention of the police, the Dumpling, a
prince of organisers, had arranged for innumerable small gatherings
in every part of London. At each of these meetings some member of
the General Council, and therefore in close touch with the Dumpling
himself, would preside, and in this way their leader's plans were made
known, a plan of campaign laid down, and concerted action arranged
in the most secret yet thorough way. Immense sums of money, so I
afterwards learned, were expended in the purchase and in the secret
storage of arms; and foreign mercenaries and expert marksmen, whose
services the Dumpling had requisitioned, were constantly pouring into
London to place themselves at his orders.

Had I still been engaged in detective work, something of all this must,
I think, have come to my notice; but I am so constituted as to be able
to do one thing only at a time. Whatever pursuit I take up, into that
pursuit I throw myself heart and soul, to the exclusion of everything
else. This temperamental defect--if a defect it be--may be the secret
of some of my many failures; it may be the secret of my few successes.
Concentration of interests generally means limitation of interests,
and whether one be racking the heavens nightly through a telescope
in search of new worlds, or only peering through a microscope, to
isolate bacilli of this or that disease--one is equally apt to become
absent-minded in other matters. So entirely had I given myself up to
studying the problem of the poor, that I had eyes for nothing else.

It is not, however, my intention further to describe, in these
pages, the harrowing scenes I witnessed while so occupied. Were I a
commissioner, appointed to report to a Committee of Inquiry upon the
condition of the poor, I should, it is true, have painful, revolting,
and even incredible facts to recount. I could give chapter and verse in
proof of inconceivable infamy. I could give instances of men, women,
and even children living under circumstances more degrading than could
be found in any so-called savage race. I should, in common honesty, be
compelled to admit that by many of these who are most in evidence, as
in search of work--work is the very last thing in the world that they
really desire to find. Hymn-bawling in the streets is the nearest most
of them have ever come to earning their bread by the sweat of their
brow; a few hours processioning and posing as unemployed, the hardest
day's work many of them ever did.

And yet, admitting all this, and speaking as one who has seen something
of the poor, and of their homes, I say, and in all sincerity, of the
very poor as a whole, that I find it hard to express my admiration, my
respect, and my reverence for the unselfishness, the courage, and the
nobility which I have known them to display.

There came a time at last when the strenuousness of the work I was
doing began to tell terribly upon me. It has been said that profound
sympathies are always in association with keen sensibilities, and
that keen sensibilities expose their possessor to a depth of anguish
utterly unintelligible to those who are differently constituted. In
my own case the hopelessness of the struggle in which I was engaged
weighed constantly upon me. Men and women--and, worst of all, little
children--were starving literally by the thousand, and all my efforts
could do no more than bring relief each day to perhaps a dozen. My
money was gone; the health by which I could earn more money was fast
giving way, and what I had accomplished, and could hope to accomplish,
seemed, when compared with what remained to be done, like the taking of
a drop of water from the sea.

One evening, after visiting a case of destitution and misery so
harrowing that it was only by a tremendous effort I was able to control
myself, and to speak cheerfully and hopefully to the sufferers, I came
out into the dark street, and, once alone, to my unspeakable disgust
and dismay, burst into tears.

When a man of strong physique, normal by nature, and in no sense
hysterical, gets into a condition so over-wrought as this, he is on the
verge of a nervous breakdown, as was proved in my own person.

The next morning I was so seriously ill that I was compelled to keep my
bed for some days, after which I was ordered to Brighton.

       *       *       *       *       *

I returned to my chambers in Adelphi Terrace on Sunday morning, to
find London dull to the very point of stagnation. So few people I do
not ever remember, even on a Sunday, to have seen in the streets.
The Strand was for once justified of its name, for it was like some
sea strand or beach from which the tide has withdrawn, leaving a
long stretch of untenanted sands. Yet that same night the returning
up-gathered tidal wave swept and broke over London like a devastating
sea.

A meeting of the unemployed was, I saw by the papers, to be held that
afternoon in Victoria Park. Instead of the few thousands whom the
public had expected to assemble, the meeting--no doubt by pre-concerted
action--mustered nearly half a million. The organisation of this
unwieldy mob was wonderful.

At five minutes to three the people were sullenly, suspiciously silent.
At three a bugle-call was heard, and suddenly in their midst the red
flag was raised, and at that sight the hounds of insurrection gave
tongue, baying for blood, in one prolonged and awful roar, that might
have been heard a mile away.

Then the Dumpling, who was standing on the pedestal of a drinking
fountain, raised his hand, and again the bugle-call rang out. Another
roar burst forth as, in every part of the open space of the park, poles
were set up, on the top of which were immense black boards, each with
a letter of the alphabet printed prominently upon it in white. With
one accord the multitude broke up to sort itself into huge companies,
according to the letter of the alphabet under which each had been
previously instructed to place himself. Another bugle-call, and from
hundreds of houses, surrounding the park, companies of men were seen to
come forth, carrying weapons for distribution. For months this secret
storage of weapons in private houses had been going on all over London,
with the result that when the outbreak came, every man knew where to
obtain a weapon. In the neighbourhood of the park itself it was, of
course, not possible to store a sufficient number of rifles to arm more
than some few thousands of men; but those so armed had been more or
less drilled and trained to shoot. They were placed in the van of the
Labour army with the foreign mercenaries--expert riflemen--immediately
in the forefront, ready to resist the first attacking force, whether of
the military or of the police.

Then, at a signal from the Dumpling, the bugle was once again sounded,
and the westward march commenced by a route so planned that weapons
for those still unarmed could be picked up at the various storage
centres on the way.

The rebel army, more than half a million strong, and led by its new
Napoleon, was marching on London. The Revolution of which the Dumpling
had so often boasted had begun.



BLOODSHED.


When, at the head of his Labour legions, the Dumpling set forth
on that eventful Sunday afternoon to march westwards, he and his
lieutenants--and, by means of his lieutenants, his men--knew exactly
what work lay in front of them. That work done, the order had gone
forth that the multitude was to break up, and each man was to return
quietly to his home, so that next day, at the hour appointed, the
legions might re-assemble, rested and ready for the fray. It was known
that the Dumpling had told off a certain number of picked and tried
men to patrol the streets after the hour of dismissal, and through
the night, and that these patrols would deal summarily with all who
disobeyed orders.

The man with a genius for organisation is rare. The man who has not
only a genius for organisation, but has also a genius for compelling
other people implicitly to accept his orders, and to abide by his
organisation --the man who can, at will, mould mankind in the lump,
as the potter moulds clay--comes only once in a hundred years. Such
a man was the Dumpling. Instead of letting his vast army straggle
invertebrately westwards under his single command, his system of
subdividing it into companies, each under a separate picked leader,
taking orders from himself, worked out with surprisingly successful
results. There was no aimless moving from place to place. Though East
London was practically in the hands of the rioters, orders had been
given that no man was to leave the ranks, and that London Fields
was to be the first halting-place, each company to march thither by
a pre-arranged route. At every open space where two or more roads
met--as, for instance, Hackney Triangle--and where assailing forces of
police or military might be expected, expert riflemen, sent on slightly
in advance of the main body, were stationed. At Hackney Triangle it
was, indeed, that the first brush with the police occurred. Some two
or three hundred of the force, hastily gathered together, attempted
to stem the onward march of the rioters. The Dumpling at once came
forward, speaking to them considerately, even humanely.

"With you personally," he said, "we have no quarrel; you we have no
wish to harm. These people are your brethren, and you are theirs. The
only difference between you and them is that you wear the uniform of a
Social System to which we are here to put an end. By that ending you
will benefit as much as we. You, no less than we, are the servants of
an iniquitous system, by which all the hardship, the toil, and the
privations of life are apportioned to one class, and all the ease,
luxury, wealth, and comfort to another. You are poorly paid; you are
iron ruled. You must tramp the streets by day and by night, exposed
to burning heat and biting cold, risking your life daily--and for
no other reason than that the rich, the vicious, the luxurious, the
sweaters of the poor, the oppressors of the people, may increase their
ill-gotten gains and live their idle, easy lives of pleasure-seeking
and debauchery. In risking your lives to protect your fellow-citizens
against crime, you are doing noble and heroic work, for which you are
inadequately paid. But _we_ are not criminals. We have done wrong to
none. We are men and women like you, compelled at last, at the cost
of our lives if it must be, to assert the common right of all God's
creatures to live. We and our wives and children have starved and
suffered over-long. But our rights we will have, so help us God, and I
appeal to you, our brother men, who have many of you wives and children
of your own, not to shed our blood, or to compel us to shed yours, in
defending ourselves. You have done your work well and faithfully, as
witness your heroic attempt--mere handful as you are--to oppose this
army of God which, as surely as you and I still breathe the breath of
life, is marching on to victory. Brother Englishmen, brother citizens,
brother sufferers, let us not shed each other's blood. Join us; throw
in your lot with us; cast off the yoke of the tyrant, and you shall
share in the rewards which shall soon be ours."

He stopped, panting with passion; and then--the words snapping like
three pistol-shots following the one after the other--came the order of
the officer in command of the police: "Arrest--that--man!"

"For God's sake, for humanity's sake, don't compel us to violence,"
interposed the Dumpling with lifted hand. "If you wish to come to
hand-grips with us, if you wish to test the temper of the people, you
shall have plenty of opportunity, I promise, later on. You have done,
at this point, all that is required. You have done your duty bravely
and well. Few as you are, compared to us, you can do nothing more. For
the present, at least, retire until the odds are less unequal. It would
be suicide, at this juncture, to oppose us by force, for in that case I
warn you I shall give my sharp-shooters the order to fire, and you will
fall almost to a man."

Again he stopped, and again came the police officer's word of command:

"Officers, do your duty. Arrest that man."

They were the last words he was to speak on earth, for as they passed
his lips the Dumpling raised a hand.

"God's will be done!" he said. "I can say no more. Riflemen, make
ready! Present! Fire!"

The result was what he had foretold. The gallant little band of police
fell, dead or dying, almost to a man.



THE BATTLE OF TOWER HILL.


From that moment onward the rebels carried all before them. The first
encounter with soldiery was at London Fields, where a regiment of
militia, hastily summoned from a neighbouring barracks, was drawn
up. The militia showed more discretion than the police, for after
discharging one volley, and being raked by a withering fire from the
rebel sharp-shooters in return, they retreated in disorder.

This time the Dumpling was less merciful.

"They have deliberately raised hand against the people, to do murder!"
he said. "And by the God whose instrument I am, for every life they
have taken, a score of them shall fall!"

Instructions were given to the rebel riflemen to continue firing so
long as one of the soldiers remained within range. The result was
disastrous to the retreating troops. In an open space with no available
cover, they could be picked off one after the other by the Dumpling's
practised marksmen, with the result that scarcely a round dozen escaped
to tell the tale.

Flushed with victory, the rebels re-formed, and the march was resumed,
this time to Tower Hill, where the Dumpling scored his first great
success of generalship.

Anticipating that at Tower Hill serious military resistance would
be offered, he had laid his plans accordingly. An enormous empty
warehouse, commanding the open space in front of the Tower, had been
rented by one of his agents, under the pretence that it was to be
the central office and storage house of a firm of tea merchants. At
this warehouse, chests and packages, purporting to contain tea, but
containing in reality rifles and ammunition, had for some days past
been delivered, and a number of men--nominally clerks, packers, and
warehousemen, but in reality expert riflemen, disloyal Boers and
foreign mercenaries--constituted the staff, and were, on the Sunday
afternoon in question, concealed upon the premises.

The secreting of these expert riflemen in a position where they could
command Tower Hill and riddle with bullets any troops assembled below,
was, however, only one item in the Dumpling's carefully planned
campaign. Knowing that it would be from the east or north-east the
rioters would approach, the officer in command of the troops had placed
his batteries so that the guns could rake both the Minories and Royal
Mint Street--the thoroughfares by which the rebel forces must almost of
necessity come. Upon Royal Mint Street and the Minories the attention
of the soldiers was consequently riveted, and when the military scouts,
who had been sent out to ascertain the movements of the enemy, came
galloping back to say that one half of the Dumpling's forces was
approaching from the north by way of the Minories and the other half
from the east by Royal Mint Street--the command was:

"Now, boys, they're coming down the two streets upon which we've got
our guns trained. Keep cool! Be ready! But don't fire and don't move,
any of you, until I give the word." And to Royal Mint Street and the
Minories every eye was turned.

All this the Dumpling had foreseen, and had laid his plans accordingly.
Why he should have been so anxious to time his arrival at Tower Hill
almost at the moment of five, those who were not acquainted with his
plan of campaign could not understand. They did not know that, at that
hour, a huge contingent of armed rebels, recruited from Bermondsey and
South London and under the leadership of the Dumpling's most trusted
lieutenant, was punctually to cross Tower Bridge, to the dismay and
consternation of the troops, who had looked for no onslaught from that
quarter. Nor did those who were not in the Dumpling's confidence know
that, at the same time, yet another contingent of armed rebels, under
able leadership, would converge upon Tower Hill from Thames Street and
Great Tower Street, so that the soldiers were simultaneously attacked
from the north, south, east, and west, and that at a moment when they
were looking for danger only from two quarters.

Everything worked out exactly as the Dumpling had planned it. At
five minutes to five the vanguards of the advancing armies were seen
approaching from Royal Mint Street and the Minories. Almost at the very
moment that the soldiers were preparing to fire, the windows of the tea
warehouse were opened, and a deadly volley poured upon the unfortunate
gunners by the riflemen who had been concealed within its walls.
Utterly taken aback and dismayed, the soldiers turned to see whence
the attack came--only to find hostile armies, in each case with picked
marksmen in the van, approaching on every hand.

Then the Dumpling gave the word to charge. In ten minutes scarcely a
soldier was left alive, their guns and their ammunition were taken,
and the Tower of London, and its armouries, were in the hands of the
Dumpling.

Contrary to the expectations of his lieutenants, he announced that
he had no intention of remaining there, or even of leaving men in
occupation.

"Clear out the place--take all we want," he said to the half-dozen who
were entirely in his confidence, "and then evacuate it. That's the
ticket! To remain here would be telling the King's troops where to find
us. That they must never know. Ours is to be a guerilla warfare. We
meet on no two days in the same place. Each night, our day's work done,
we disband--to re-assemble next day and to descend upon our enemies
from North, South, East, or West, or possibly from all four corners of
the compass together, as the chances of war may make necessary. As a
strategic position, the Tower of London is of no earthly use to us. But
we haven't done all our work here yet.

"First, call up the string of forage vans which I have ordered to keep
well in our rear, and give instructions to the men to have a good meal.
The last three vans have red crosses upon them, as if to indicate that
they contain hospital requirements. So they do--two of them, that is.
The third contains the bombs and explosives which we carried away
that night from the opium den. Before leaving this place we have to
construct a secret mine--you must do the work yourselves--by which we
can at any time blow up the Tower and everyone in it, in case the enemy
should garrison it and use it as vantage ground against us. Get to work
at once and report to me when all is ready, for we have other business
on hand to-night, that London and England and all the world may know we
mean to carry out what we have begun."

Two hours later, the bugle-calls to re-assemble were sounded, and the
rebel army re-formed to march westward by way of the Minories and
Leadenhall Street to Cornhill, and so to the Bank of England, the Stock
Exchange, the Royal Exchange, and the Mansion House, all of which were
sacked and looted by the revolutionaries.

This--so the Dumpling had decided--was to end the work for that day.
The bugles of dismissal were sounded; and little by little the great
armies of Labour melted away.



LONDON IN REVOLUTION.


Because the Rising had seemingly broken out in one day, because on the
Saturday night London had gone to bed in peace and quietness, on the
Sunday night London was aflame, and, on the Monday morning, London
was apparently at peace again--because of all this, some hope was
entertained in certain high official quarters that the trouble would
subside as suddenly as it had arisen.

So, at least--possibly for the prevention of panic--it was pretended,
and when, at mid-day, there was no sign of a reassembling of the forces
under the Dumpling's command the belief was expressed in certain early
afternoon papers that the threatened safety of the Empire was assured.

But the police were wiser. They knew that though the firing of the fuse
had been but a night's, or even a moment's, work, the laying of the
mine had been going on for years; and though the suddenness of the
rising, coming as it did on a Sunday, had taken them unawares, it had
not found them altogether unprepared, as after-events proved.

But on Monday, at mid-day, a sudden reaction set in. The wildest
rumours were afloat of some awful danger that assailed not only London,
but the very Empire.

The fact of the Dumpling's extraordinary resemblance to Napoleon,
and of his claim to be the great Napoleon himself, had got abroad,
and religious fanatics proclaimed him to be the Beast of the Book of
Revelation, the anti-Christ who was to come. Them and their diatribes
no sane man heeded; but that something was afoot which directly
menaced our very existence as a nation, was believed by all. It was
openly stated that the Dumpling and the German Emperor were acting in
concert, and that it was from Germany that the arms and the funds which
furnished the rioters with the sinews of war had come.

The Kaiser was depicted as not only jealous of the popularity of King
Edward, but as hating the form of Limited Monarchy which exists in
England, and as anxious to establish, first in Europe, and finally all
over the world, the autocratic rule which prevails in his own country
and in Russia. The Dumpling--so it was openly stated--had succeeded
in convincing the Kaiser of the genuineness of his claim to be the
re-incarnation of Napoleon. An agreement had been come to between the
two men by which it was arranged that, if the Kaiser would assist
the Dumpling to obtain supreme power in England, this country should
be put under the rule of an Absolute Monarchy even more despotic and
more autocratic than that of Russia and Germany. That once achieved,
the German Emperor and the Dumpling would combine against France, and
re-establish the Monarchy there.

Already, so it was stated, the German war squadron was on its way
to England, and German vessels of every sort were conveying an army
of half a million of men to this country, nominally to assist King
Edward's troops in crushing the rebellion. Once, however, they had
succeeded in effecting a landing, the real purpose for which they
had come here would be revealed, and they would co-operate with the
Dumpling's forces, and officially recognise his claim to be Emperor
of England and of France. The fact that a German squadron had sailed
with sealed orders the day before the outbreak, lent some colour
to this preposterous theory, and the fact, also, that undoubtedly
something in the nature of a panic prevailed at Court, went far to
support it. What was wrong there nobody knew. The Prince of Wales and
the Prime Minister, it was known, had been hastily summoned, and had
driven to Buckingham Palace in hot haste, surrounded on every side by
escorts large enough to be spoken of as small armies. An hour after
their arrival, the King, so it was stated, had, in response to a loyal
demonstration outside the Palace, appeared for a moment at a window,
hurriedly bowed, and as hurriedly retired.

Clearly something was wrong at Court, and what that something was, and
how intimately concerned in it I was to be, I could not in my wildest
dreams have conceived.



THE GREAT FIGHT IN FLEET STREET.


Until three o'clock on Monday afternoon there was no new disturbance,
no reassembling of the rioters; but soon after that hour it was clear
that something was astir. This time there was no marching in companies,
but the vast crowds that were quietly but systematically pouring
cityward from every quarter were clearly acting under instructions, and
according to some method of organisation. So far as I could see, it was
towards the open space in front of the Royal Exchange that the crowd
was converging, and thither I allowed myself to be carried with the
stream.

On this occasion it was quite clear that the mob was neither sanguine
nor confident, and for this there were reasons. The first was the
absence of the Dumpling. That he was to have met his lieutenants at
a certain hour, and at a certain place, that morning, but for some
unaccountable cause had failed to keep the appointment, was already
common knowledge. When he was present, that heterogeneous gathering
seemed organic. It acted not as a mob, but as one man; and one man,
in a sense, it was, since each contingent--come as it might from
Bermondsey, from Poplar, or from Canning Town--seemed like one of
the limbs of a human body, of which this man, the Dumpling, was the
controlling brain.

By his absence, however, this body politic seemed dismembered. The
magnetism exercised by his single personality was extraordinary. So
long as he was known to be at their head, the rioters followed their
appointed leaders, his lieutenants, with fearless confidence, moving
and acting in concert, not like an undisciplined mob, but like drilled
troops, trained and controlled by a master of men. Now, in a single
day, the whole movement seemed, in his absence, to have gone to pieces.

Another reason for the nervousness of the rioters was the mysterious
action, or inaction, of the military and the police. No attempt
either to prevent the people from assembling, or to disperse
them when assembled, had been made; and no blue or red-coated
myrmidons of the civil or of the military forces had attempted to
bar the thoroughfares, or to offer opposition of any sort to the
revolutionaries. With the Dumpling present, as their leader and head,
the absence of the police and of the military would have been counted
by the mob as a signal proof of the completeness of their victory. With
him away, it seemed ominous of ambush, pregnant with evil; and when
the Dumpling's second in command announced that he intended, in their
leader's absence, to carry out the plan of campaign as arranged by
their leader himself, and gave the order for the riflemen to form up,
and for the rank and file to fall in behind, the order, though obeyed,
was obeyed spiritlessly and unwillingly.

Then came the news that troops, mounted and on foot, were approaching
by way of Queen Victoria Street and Cheapside; and as the trees of a
great forest sway and waver before the coming of a storm, so over the
rebel army there passed a sudden tremor, as if the members of that army
were undecided whether to fight or to fly.

Sharp and clear, however, came the words of command, and sullenly the
legions of Labour prepared for the fray. Once again victory rested
with the revolutionaries. Nor was I surprised, for to me, at that stage
of the struggle, it seemed as if the police and the soldiers had bided
their time too long. An armed mob gathered together in the space known
as the Poultry, and holding all the approaches, would be difficult
to dislodge, presenting as it did a solid phalanx to any opposing
force which, owing to the comparative narrowness of the converging
thoroughfares, would of necessity be compelled to present a somewhat
narrow front to the rebel army. Queen Victoria Street, it is true,
being broad, would allow the soldiery to come on in companies, forming
an attacking line of formidable length. This, however, the Dumpling's
second in command had realised, for, immediately facing Queen Victoria
Street, he placed the pick of the rebel riflemen. No sooner did the
troop of cavalry, which was advancing upon the rioters, come within
range, than the barrels of the riflemen, and the saddles of the front
row of soldiery, were almost simultaneously emptied. After each volley
Queen Victoria Street was for a moment blocked by a line of dead
and dying soldiers and horses, but no sooner was the opposing line
re-formed, and ready to come on, before another volley from the rebel
riflemen emptied every saddle again.

In Queen Victoria Street, at least, the victory of the rebels was
complete, and what happened to the troops in Queen Victoria Street,
happened upon a smaller scale to the police and to the military who
attempted to disperse the mob by making charges by way of Cheapside,
Lombard Street, and the other narrower approaches. Recognising the
hopelessness of the position, and anxious to husband their strength for
the final struggle, the officers in command of the police and of the
military gave the word for withdrawal. In this withdrawal the mob saw
a tacit admission of defeat, and became more reckless, more eager for
destruction, more difficult of organisation. Freed from the restraining
and controlling influence of the Dumpling, it swept along Cheapside to
St. Paul's and down Ludgate Hill, no longer an organised rising with
a definite end in view, but a rabble of reckless ruffians, ready and
greedy to rob, to rape, to wreck, and to destroy.

At Ludgate Circus it divided, part going westward by way of Fleet
Street and the Strand, another part by way of St. Bride Street, and
yet another by the Embankment.

Then it was that the police and the soldiery showed how prepared
they were for the outbreak, how admirable was their organisation.
Suddenly down St. Bride Street, and moving by some inside and unseen
motor-power, there appeared a procession of engines of war, the like
of which none of the rioters had ever seen. These engines had been
constructed secretly and in sections so as to be ready to put together
and run out at a moment's notice, and had been concealed at the various
fire stations till such time as they should be required.

Imagine, if you can, that a square-built fort had suddenly detached
itself at the corners, so as to break up into four armed sections, each
of which presented on either side an iron-plated front, almost as steep
and almost as high as the side of a house, with gun-mouths grinning
out at regular intervals. Armoured trains the rioters had heard of,
but armoured sides of an iron-built house, moving, each complete in
itself, upon unseen wheels in a long procession down St. Bride Street,
was something entirely new. For an instant the mob surged back, awed
and wondering. Then, like an angry sea leaping against a breakwater, it
flung itself forward upon the first of these new and advancing engines
of war.

But for the tragic loss of life, the impotency of the rush would have
been ludicrous. It was as if a child, by the throwing of a handful of
sand, had tried to stop a motor-car going at the top of its speed. The
huge instrument of war not only did not swerve an inch from its course,
but, so great was its weight, that it passed, without so much as a
bump, over the bodies of those who fell beneath it, scrunching bone and
limb into shapeless and quivering pulp.

Then from either side belched sheets of flame, and, for the first time
since the rising, the mob fell back and away, leaving the monsters of
war-mechanism to accomplish their manœuvres unhindered.

On the four moving walls filed, like a troop of ambling elephants. The
foremost wheeled heavily round the obelisk in the centre of Ludgate
Circus till it blocked London southwards by barricading off New Bridge
Street and Blackfriars Bridge. The second steered round the obelisk
westward, till it faced and closed Fleet Street. The third stretched
itself eastward across the foot of Ludgate Hill; and the fourth,
by spanning the road where St. Bride Street and Farringdon Street
bifurcate, thus closed those roads to all comers.

The four walls now formed a huge square, and as soldiers "dress" the
line and close up in a drill yard, so at a given signal--a shrill
whistle twice repeated--the four sides edged closer and closer
together, till, if I may use such a term, they touched elbows. Then
came a second signal--the same whistle three times repeated--and now
there were the clink and rattle of bolts and chains. The four walls
were locked impregnably together, thus forming a fort, facing London on
every side. No sooner was the locking accomplished than, upon the walls
of the fort, hundreds of policemen swarmed to complete the closing up
of the streets. At a word of command from above, iron barriers shot out
to the required lengths from the four corners of the fort below, and
when it was impossible to adjust these barriers with sufficient nicety,
absolutely to close every opening, huge sacks of sand were hurled from
the walls, so that in less than five minutes the army of rioters was
divided up into four separate wings, each for the moment effectually
cut off from holding any communication with any of the others.

The great body of the rebel army and the riflemen were, however, now
west of Ludgate Circus, and passing up Fleet Street and the Strand; so
that the closing of the ways seemed for a few minutes to have come too
late.

But the authorities who had anticipated this outbreak, and prepared
for it by constructing these street-barricading forts, knew what they
were about. From mouth to mouth of the rebels, passing up Fleet Street,
Strandwards, the word was repeated that similar forts now blocked
advance at Charing Cross.

Panic-stricken, the mob surged down the side streets to the Embankment,
only to find that similar barriers had been erected at either end.
Then the forts at every point opened fire, and with terrible results.
The scenes that followed I do not wish further to describe, except to
say that, for the present at least, the rout of the leaderless rebels
was complete, and only a shattered section escaped to press on to
Buckingham Palace, the point to which all contingents of that great
army had been instructed to converge.



PRINCE DUMPLING.


At Charing Cross, soon after the defeat and dispersion of the rebels,
I had caught sight of a face which set my heart beating wildly--the
proud, pale face of Kate, who was sitting at the window of a hotel.
Sending up my name, I was at once admitted, Kate clinging to me, and
crying over me, as if I were a soldier returned from the wars.

"I won't leave you again, darling," I said, "no matter what you or your
aunt may command or urge. How is that kindest of friends of mine?"

"I haven't seen her since soon after you--you--you--left us," was the
reply. "She went away by herself on some important business, and was
to have returned to-day to Taunton Square, where I have been staying
for the last week by myself. But something happened there that--that
frightened and upset me, Max dear, so I came on here, and left word to
Aunt Clara where to find me. Ah! here she is."

Miss Clara kissed first Kate and then me, after which, turning to her
niece, she said:

"What was it that frightened you and drove you away from Taunton
Square? The rioters?"

"No, aunt. I--I--hardly know how to tell you and Max. It was so
terrible. It was--it was--the Dumpling."

"The Dumpling!" exclaimed Miss Clara and I together.

"Yes, the Dumpling," replied Kate, putting her hands before her eyes,
as if to shut out some hateful vision. "I wasn't so much afraid of him
as of what I saw in his eyes--that awful picture----"

"I have something to tell you about him myself," said Miss Clara,
quietly. "Something that it is time both you and Max knew. But, first,
let us hear your story."

"I was sitting alone one evening in the dark in the conservatory,"
said Kate, "and feeling suddenly cold and frightened--I did not know
at what--I put out a hand and switched on the electric light. There,
glaring in at me from the window outside, I saw a man's face. It was
the man Max called the Dumpling. I recognised him at once by the
description. The face was gone almost as I looked, but before it
went I saw a picture in its eyes--a picture that seemed to be--that
something tells me _was_ true, but is so awful that I can hardly bear
to think, still less to speak, of it. But speak of it I must, for I can
bear the suspense no longer.

"I saw myself as a girl, standing in a church before an altar, being
married to this terrible man! Aunt, darling! Tell me it was all a
dream, and that it isn't true. It seemed hideously, cruelly true as I
saw it; and I know, now, that I have seen him before--that the man is
no stranger to me, and that I knew him long ago."

"Yes, darling," said the elder Miss Carleton, taking the sobbing girl
in her arms, "it is quite true. Listen, and you shall hear the facts.
I can tell them in a very few words. You were a mere girl of seventeen
at a boarding school in America when you first met this man. He was one
of the masters, and was known as 'The Prince,' because he claimed to be
a son of Napoleon the Third, and, in fact, I believe there was truth
in his claim. But he fell desperately in love with you, and you, an
innocent girl, with no thought of husband or love-making, laughed at
him. All this you will remember yourself. What you will not remember is
that the man, who has strange occult powers, hypnotised or mesmerised
you one day, and when you were in that state, and did not know what you
were doing, compelled you to go through the form of marriage with him.
I was staying in the neighbourhood of the school at the time, so as to
be near you, your dear mother being recently dead; and hearing that you
had been seen going out with 'The Prince'--no one knew why--I found out
in what direction you and he had gone, and followed, for I disliked and
distrusted him from the first. But I was too late. The ceremony was
over. You were--and, I fear, are--the man's wife. Even if we had gone
to law, to attempt to upset the marriage, we might not have won, for
hypnotic influence is hard to prove in the unsympathetic atmosphere of
the law courts, and, even if we had won, the scandal and shock might
have killed you, for you were already worn to a shadow by fretting for
your mother. I shrank from the thought of such a scandal, as I knew you
would have shrunk; and, rightly or wrongly, I did what seemed best to
me under the circumstances. I am not long in making up my mind, and, my
mind once made up, I do not hesitate to act.

"You were sitting, white and trembling, in a pew near the door. 'The
Prince' had followed the minister into an inner room or vestry, perhaps
to pay the fee. The key of the vestry door was on the outside. Without
a moment's hesitation I turned the key, locking the two of them in,
so as to give us a few minutes in which to get away. Then I got you
out, half supporting you, half carrying you, to where my own carriage
was waiting, lifted you in, jumped in myself, and told the coachman
to drive with all possible speed to the railway station. Here we were
just in time to catch an express to New York, and when you recovered
from the mesmeric state into which you had been thrown, and I found
that you knew nothing of what had happened, I determined to keep my own
counsel, and have told no one--not even your own father--the facts.
From New York we went next day to Europe, travelling from country to
country, so that the villain who had ruined your life might never
find you. I had hoped that he was long since dead, and it was only
when Max was telling us of the Dumpling's claim to be Napoleon that
the horrible possibility--a possibility which afterwards became a
certainty--occurred to me.

"Even in those far-away days he had dreams of a revolution which he
was one day to accomplish in England; even then he was passionately in
sympathy with the poor, and talked about them exactly as he talked to
Max. I recognised, from Max's description, the man whom he called 'The
Dumpling,' as the man you and I had long ago known as 'The Prince,'
and realised that he had tracked us at last. That was why Max saw him
shadowing the house, and that is why you saw his face watching you
through the window-pane. That was why I sent Max away, for while that
man lives you can never be Max's wife."

"She _shall_ be my wife," I interrupted, "if only she will consent to
do me such high honour; for be this man 'Prince,' or be he 'Dumpling,'
he has no power to come between Kate and me. You have told your
story--now listen to mine."



THE MAN IN THE CELLAR.


"Yesterday night--so much has happened since then that it is difficult
to believe it was so short a time ago--yesterday night, after the
rioters had disbanded and gone home, I returned to my rooms in Adelphi
Terrace, and after I had had some supper, I stepped out on the balcony,
to smoke and to listen if all was quiet.

"As I re-entered my room, someone, concealed behind one of the heavy
curtains, seized me suddenly from behind, and as I turned angrily to
free myself and to see who was my assailant, another man stepped out
from behind the curtain on the other side of the window, and before I
could prevent him, clapped a handkerchief saturated with chloroform
over my nose and mouth.

"When I came to myself, I found myself sitting in a strange room in the
presence of the Dumpling.

"'Mr. Rissler,' he said, 'I am very sorry to have been compelled to
chloroform and to abduct you. Believe me, no harm is intended you.
That I should have an immediate interview at this point was imperative,
and to bring you here, in the way in which you have been brought, was
the safest, and quickest, and most convenient method. You might have
refused to come, or you might have frittered away invaluable time in
profitless discussions. And I, at least at the present juncture, have
no time to waste. You know that the revolution, of which I have already
spoken to you, has begun in earnest, and you know, no doubt, that
success has crowned our efforts to-day, and that London is practically
at our mercy.

"'My reason for sending for you is that I have something to show
you which will convince even you--difficult as you have been to
persuade--of the folly of refusing to make terms with us; something
that will induce you at last to throw in your lot with us, to become
one of us, and my acknowledged successor when I fall; something that
even you cannot deny is incontrovertible proof of our absolute and
complete success.

"'No, don't say anything at this point, please,' he interrupted,
holding up a repressing hand, for I was about to protest that nothing
he could say, or could show me, would have the slightest influence in
inducing me even to consider his proposition.

"'I know what you are going to say,' he went on. 'You are about to
repudiate me and all my work. But wait! Say nothing yet which you might
afterwards regret and wish to withdraw. God has marked you out for
this work as surely as He has marked me, and that God is behind us, is
working with us and for us, even you will admit when you see the proof
which I shall soon put before you. I have never despaired of winning
you, Rissler. Like Saul of Tarsus, you have fought against God and
against His prophets, but even as Saul was convinced and converted to
God's will by the sign which came to him on the road to Damascus, even
so will you be convinced and converted by the sign which I am about to
make known to you. As Saul hardened his heart before the coming of the
heavenly vision, even so have you hardened your heart against God's
will. But God can change your heart and open your eyes at a word, even
as He opened the eyes and changed the heart of Saul; and ere I die I
shall see you an acknowledged leader and hope of the armies of Labour
and of the Lord.'

"He walked over to a cupboard in a corner, and, to my astonishment,
took out a huge military cloak with an immense collar, and a
three-cornered hat like that worn by Napoleon.

"Drawing the cloak over his shoulders, and donning the hat, he stood
for some minutes, his huge head sunk between his shoulders till his
chin lay on his chest, his short legs straddled apart, and his hands
clasped behind him, deep in thought. Amused as I was by his ranting
and by the theatrical way in which he posed and dressed the part, his
likeness to the great Napoleon was so uncanny, so extraordinary, that,
in spite of myself, I was awed and impressed. Then, with the single
word 'Come,' he turned and went out, I following him.

"Coming to the front door of the house, he opened it cautiously and
looked out. We were in a narrow and shabby side street of what I judged
to be the East End of London. At the moment of our emergence not a
single soul was in sight. The Dumpling crossed the road and gave four
slow and deliberate knocks at a door.

"'Who is there?' said a voice inside.

"'God and Napoleon and the Dumpling strike with granite arm!' was the
reply, and the door was immediately opened, the Dumpling and I stepping
inside. We were in the narrow hall or passage of a small dwelling
house. The man who had admitted us closed the door, and then resumed
his chair, which was placed just inside the door. A newspaper which he
had been reading lay beside him on the floor, and two small paraffin
lamps burned--or, rather, smoked--beside him on another chair.

"'All quiet, doorkeeper?' asked the Dumpling.

"'All quiet, sir,' was the answer.

"Then the Dumpling took up one of the lamps.

"'This way, Rissler,' he said, walking along the passage, till he came
to a door leading to the basement or kitchen portion of the house.
Producing a bunch of keys from his pocket, he unlocked the door, and
when he and I had passed through, locked it carefully again.

"Passing down some stairs, we came to a stone-flagged passage, along
which we walked to another door, leading to a sort of underground
cellar. This door the Dumpling also unlocked, and, after we had
entered, re-locked; and as he did so, the dream-picture which I had
once seen in his eyes, the picture of the Dumpling, myself, and a third
and unknown man, standing together in an underground room, came back to
me, and I knew that the place I was now in was the place I had seen in
the tableau.

"Then the Dumpling touched a spring, and a hidden door flew open,
revealing a smaller inner room. A man, nonchalantly smoking a cigar,
was standing in a far corner, and as, obeying the Dumpling's signal, I
passed through the door and saw his face, I gave a short, sharp cry,
and fell back in incredulous horror.

"'My God!' I said. 'It is not possible! The King!'"



THE MANTLE OF NAPOLEON.


"'On the contrary,' said the Dumpling, with a short laugh of devilish
triumph, 'on the contrary, it is quite possible with a King so trustful
that he goes out for an evening stroll unattended. I admit that it
cost us much laying of plans, and that we had mapped out, and prepared
for the abduction, half a hundred times before the actual chance came
which it was safe to take. But, as you know, my dear Rissler, I don't
do things by halves. London is practically in my hands, and when the
fact of the King's disappearance leaks out, and we carry out the
master-stroke which is planned to come off to-morrow, the campaign will
practically be at an end, and victory, absolute and assured, be ours.
They are doing their best at Court to keep the King's disappearance
secret, and have even gone so far, I am told, as to fix up an imitation
King, to come to the window and bow and show himself, and dupe the
public--as, for some inexplicable reason, they always do try to dupe
the public when the health or the life or the death of royal persons
is concerned. But they can't keep the secret much longer, and now that
London is in our hands, and his Majesty is here in safe keeping and our
prisoner, I trust and believe that he will prove reasonable and accede
to our very moderate terms.'

"It is, perhaps, not difficult for a King to impress onlookers with
his kingliness, when he is throned and robed and surrounded by bowing
courtiers, or when he is seen at the head of his army. But never had
King of England looked kinglier than King Edward the Seventh looked
when, a prisoner and alone, in squalid, sordid surroundings, he turned,
and thundered out:

"'Terms! I make no terms with murderers!'"

"'Murderers!'" hissed the Dumpling, menacingly. 'Remember that you are
in my hands, my prisoner, unarmed and defenceless, and take back that
word, or by God you shall answer for it with your life.'

"'I am in God's hands,' replied the King quietly, 'and He will see to
it that I am soon taken out of the hands of such as you. As for your
threats,' he laughed contemptuously, 'I will take back no word of what
I have said, even to save my life. But I waste breath arguing with one
who is a madman as well as a murderer!'

"'And when your Majesty is once more in possession of the liberty which
he is so convinced God is about to restore to him, what do you propose
to do with me?' inquired the Dumpling mockingly.

"'With you!' said the King stolidly, but with infinite contempt. 'With
you! Nothing. I am this country's King, not the common hangman. You
shall be dealt with by the proper authorities--make yourself easy
about that. You shall be examined, and if you are pronounced insane,
will be clapped between walls, out of the way of working mischief to
yourself or to others. If you are sane, you will be shot or hanged, or
whatever it is they do to traitors and treason-workers. I'm tolerably
well versed in methods of procedure, but fortunately you are the first
traitor who's directly crossed my path.

"'But listen to me, you sir. Whatever punishment it is that is meted
out to such as you--whether hanging by the common hangman or whether
it be to be shot like a dangerous dog--I'll lift no hand to stay it.
Not because of the personal indignity and affront you have dared to
offer to me, but because' (his voice rose, and he looked terrible in
his kingly wrath), 'because' (and now there was a tremor of pity in
his tone), 'because by you the blood of my loyal and true soldiers, my
brave officers, has been spilt, and because you have been the means
of bringing untold misery and suffering upon my people, whom you have
led away by your treason and by your devilries. For that, believe me,
unsparing vengeance shall be exacted.'

"The Dumpling, who was livid with passion, turned away, and taking off
his cloak (his hat he had placed on a chair when coming in) laid it
upon a table.

"As he did so, I saw the handle of a dagger protruding from an inner
pocket, and as he turned to face the King again, I whipped it out, and
thrusting it under my coat, clapped my left arm lightly against my
side, to keep the weapon from slipping down. Then the King turned to
me:

"'As for you, sir, I do not know who you may be, and do not greatly
care. But that you should be privy to this traitor and villain's
devilry, proclaims you villain and traitor too, and I promise that you,
as well as he, shall receive short shrift when you come into the hands
of justice.'

"'Sir,' I said, falling on one knee and bowing lowly, 'believe me that
I am no traitor, and no friend of this man, but your Majesty's loyal
and loving subject, who is prepared to defend, with his own life, your
Majesty's sacred person.'

"Then I rose and turned to the Dumpling, who was laughing derisively.

"'Very pretty indeed!' he said, slapping me jovially on the back. ''Pon
my word, Rissler, I had no idea you were such a born courtier--and
actor! It tripped off your tongue as readily as if you had been
rehearsing it for weeks, and the way you dropped on your knee, and
bowed, couldn't be beaten in the best Court circles--or on the stage.
Don't tell me that you didn't all along suspect the surprise I had in
store for you. You have been rehearsing that bow and knee-drop before a
cheval-glass, I'll wager, and many a time. It does you credit, anyhow;
and whether it was a rehearsed or an unprepared effect, it proves you
to be a man of parts, and one who is an acquisition to any cause.

"'But what you have said puts a different complexion upon my plans for
your future,' he went on. 'I should like a word with you in the other
room before we go any farther. Your Majesty must excuse my friend here
and myself if we retire for a few moments.'

"Taking up the cloak and hat from the chair, he put both on and walked
towards the door.

"'Have I your permission, Sir, to hear what this man has to say?' I
inquired, turning to the King. 'I go or stay, as you may command, and
am ready, if need be, as I have said, to prove my loyalty with my life.'

"There is no keener judge of character in all England than the King,
and the look which, for a moment, he bent upon me was so searching, so
penetrating, so compelling, that I admit I found it hard to face.

"'You keep queer company!' he said with stern bluffness; and something
there was, in the way he looked and spoke, which, even in that most
eventful moment of my life, recalled past scenes of English history
to my memory, and reminded me strangely of more than one of his great
ancestors.

"'My company,' I replied gravely, 'is not of my choosing. What has
happened to me might have happened to your Majesty's most loyal
subject--might conceivably have happened, I venture humbly to suggest,
to one who is subject to none in this kingdom. I am here, not by my
own consent, but by compulsion. An hour ago I was suddenly taken by
surprise, and from behind, by superior numbers, and before I could
resist or summon assistance, was forcibly drugged, abducted, and
carried senseless to this place. Believe me, Sir, that I am as little
deserving of reproach, on the score of the company I keep, as I am
unworthy to stand in the august presence in which I now find myself.'

"So saying, I dropped again upon one knee, and bent my head. When I
looked up, I saw that the knitting of the brows over the eyes, which
had been so sternly bent upon me, was relaxed. By a gesture he bade me
to rise, and then, without speaking, nodded to the door, to indicate
that I had his permission to withdraw. Walking backwards, I passed
out, to find the Dumpling, who had preceded me, on the other side.

"After closing the door, locking it, and pocketing the key, he took my
arm in a friendly way, and led me into another room, lit by a smoky
lamp.

"'My dear Rissler,' he began, 'I don't deny that you have disappointed
me, but, after all, it is only what I might have expected, and my
regard for you is so great that----'

"His hand was feeling, as he spoke, for the dagger which had been in
the inside pocket of his cloak. Missing it, he turned suddenly upon me,
his eyes blazing with maniacal fury and fire; but before he could lift
hand, I struck him squarely, with all my strength, between the eyes,
and, as he reeled back, I snatched at the handle of the dagger, and
stabbed him to the heart at one stroke."



"GOD SAVE THE KING!"


Kate gave a terrible cry as the words fell from my lips, and snatching
away the hand which I had been holding, staggered, white and faint, to
the sofa.

"Don't turn from me, darling," I said, kneeling beside her. "No one
who fears God and honours his King, who loves his country, could
have acted other than I did. The man meant well, meant nobly, I
believe, originally, and his passion and devotion to the cause of the
poor I shall remember with reverence to the end of my life. But his
well-meaning had passed into mania, so that he had become, as you know,
a relentless and wholesale murderer, whose very existence was a menace
to the nation. I struck because I was compelled, and in self-defence. I
had no option, for his intention at the moment was to murder me. Had I
spared him, he would either have died at the hangman's hands, or, more
horrible still, have dragged out his remaining years in a madhouse.
You are a woman, darling; not a girl any longer--a brave woman, a true
woman, and must see that, terrible as it was and is, I should have been
a traitor to my King and country had I failed to act as I did, for, mad
for blood as the man was, he might--would, I believe, within the next
few minutes--have murdered the King himself."

"It is horrible!" she said, shuddering. "Horrible! But I will be brave,
dear, and I do see, horrible as it is, that you are right. Is he dead?"

"He is dead," I replied.

Again she buried her face in her hands and sank back sobbing. But soon
the sobs became less frequent, and at last she was composed enough to
motion to me with her hand to finish the story.

"And what happened then?" interposed Miss Clara.

"Then," I went on, "I took the keys out of the dead man's pocket, and
arraying myself in the Napoleon cloak, the huge collar of which I drew
up to my ears, and clapping the hat on my head, well down over my
eyes, I made my way to the front door. The man in charge was still at
his post, and looked up for a moment on hearing me turn the key in
the lock, but seeing the hat and cloak of his leader, did not trouble
himself to look again. Making a show of locking the door, I turned, and
with my head sunk on my chest, my legs straddled apart in imitation of
the Dumpling, and my hand--the right--holding the dagger behind me, I
walked slowly towards him. He slipped the paper he had been reading
into his pocket, and rose, as if to open the door for me, but, before
shooting back the bolt, he turned, and raising his hand soldier-wise in
salute, said:

"Shall I send word, sir, that----"

"He stopped short with a sudden gasp of surprise, realising, as his
eyes fell upon me, that something was wrong; but, before he could utter
a word or raise a hand, my dagger was in his heart."

Again Kate reeled, as if about to faint.

"More blood on your hands! Another life taken! The first, perhaps,
_had_ to be, but this man had done no direct harm, this man----"

"Kate," I interrupted her sternly, "this, too, as you put it, '_had_ to
be.' The issues at stake were too tremendous to justify me in running
any risk. And this man was an English-speaking foreign mercenary,
whom I, with my own eyes, saw deliberately murder two policemen and a
soldier in cold blood and without mercy."

"And the King?" she gasped, white to the lips.

"The King," I said, "is safe. I stayed only to put the body out of
sight, and to cover up the traces of the tragedy, before going back to
set him free. The rising is over. It is the King himself who has given
it its death-blow. When the contingent of rioters, who had succeeded
in passing the barriers, reached Buckingham Palace, the King declared
his intention of going out himself to meet them. Notwithstanding the
Queen's tears, the Prince's entreaties, his Ministers' prayers, he
refused to be turned from his purpose.

"'I am not afraid of my people,' he said unconcernedly, 'and I do not
think my people will harm me.'

"Walking to a window on the ground floor, he threw it up, and standing
upon a chair in sight of all, spoke to the crowd.

"'My friends!' he said. 'My people, whom I have loved, and who have
never yet before failed in love to me, you have been misled by a
madman and a murderer, who is now dead. The uproar began with him, and
with his death it will assuredly end. Your leaders, those who have
planned and carried out this treason and this devilry, and those who
have shed blood, must answer to the law for what they have done, and
must answer, it may be, with their lives.

"'But for you, my people, who have been blinded, duped, and misled
by the dead arch-traitor who called himself the Dumpling, to you, my
people, if you now disperse and go to your homes, free pardon and
forgiveness shall be extended. It is your King who says it, and your
King's word is enough.

"'And now, listen. I am not afraid of my people, and I do not think
there is one sane man among my people who would harm me. See, I come
out to you of my own accord, unescorted, unattended, and unarmed.'

"Stepping upon the window-sill, he said, laughingly:

"'I am not so young or as light-footed as I used to be. Will one of you
lend me a hand?'

"A hundred hands were extended, and then, hatless as he was, he leapt
down into the courtyard among his subjects, as much at home and with as
little fear as if he were among a crowd of sightseers on a race-course
or at a review.

"At the words and at the action, there arose such a cheer as London has
never heard before, and though some traitors there were, who murmured
among themselves, and looked at him darkly, not one of them dared raise
hand against the Sovereign, knowing that to do so would be the signal
for the people to tear the traitor limb from limb.

"The rebellion is over, Kate. The King himself, as I have said, gave it
the death-blow. Before I left the Palace, the people had thrown down
their arms to a man, and all London is ringing on every hand with the
cry 'God save the King!'"

"Thank God!" she said, "for the King's sake and the people's. But hush,
Max! What is that shouting in the street? It is coming nearer. Pray God
the rioting has not broken out again."

"I have no fear of that," I said. "But come, dear, let us see."

Together we walked to the window. The shouting and cheering in the
street were terrific, but this was no disloyal mob--these were no
revolutionaries. They were cheering a gentleman who, unattended, and
without escort, was riding slowly by in an open carriage.

"It is the King!" Kate gasped.

"Yes," I said. "It is the kingliest ruler, the bravest man, the truest
gentleman in Christendom!"

And raising the window, she and I stepped out hand in hand upon the
balcony, to join in the jubilation and welcome that rose from a
thousand throats in a roar louder than the roar of the central seas.

"The King! God bless him!"

"The King! The King! The King!"

WHY THIS IS WRITTEN.

Wilford Heaton is not my real name, for why should I publish it to the
world?

The reason I do not give it is, first, because I have no desire to be
made the object of idle curiosity or speculation, and secondly, although
the explanation herein given will clear the honour of one of the most
powerful of the Imperial Houses in Europe, I have no wish that my true
name should be associated with it.

I have, however, a reason for writing this narrative--a very strong
reason.

The story is an enthralling one; the adventures stranger, perhaps, than
ever happened to any other living person.  I have resolved to relate the
plain unvarnished facts in their sequence, just as they occurred,
without seeking to suppress or embellish, but to recount the strange
adventures just as they are registered in the small leather portfolio,
or secret dossier, which still, at this moment, reposes in the archives
of a certain Ministry in one of the European capitals.

There have recently been stories afloat--strange stories.  At first I
laughed at all the absurd rumours, but very quickly I saw how seriously
distorted the real facts had become, for ingenious paragraphs of certain
so-called Society papers, grasping the story eagerly, worked it up into
a narrative which reflected very seriously upon the honour of one who is
dearest in all the world to me.

Well, my tale--or exposure--is written here.

In order that those who read may clearly follow the curious chain of
circumstances, it is necessary for me to go back some eight years or
so--not a long period as far as time goes, but to me a veritable
century.  I was young, just turned twenty five.  I was decently
well-off, having come into an income of nearly a couple of thousand a
year left me by my father, a sum which put me beyond the necessity of
entering business, pursuing the daily grind, or troubling about the
morrow.  My career at Oxford had, I fear, been marked by a good many
shortcomings and many youthful escapades, but I ended it by taking my
degree of Bachelor of Medicine, shortly afterwards pursuing the
fashionable habit of "going abroad."  Within two years, however, I
returned to London world-weary--like so many other young men who, being
left comfortably off, commence to taste the enjoyment of life too
early--and settled down in a suite of smoke-begrimed rooms in Essex
Street, Strand.

The place was horribly dingy, situated in that _cul-de-sac_ which is
quiet and almost deserted, even though only a stone's throw from the
busiest, noisiest, and muddiest thoroughfare in the world.  The ground
and first floors of the house were occupied by several firms of
solicitors, whose doors were covered with ragged and sadly faded green
baize, while the second floor I rented as my abode.  The quaint, shabby,
bizarre old place had been built at the end of the last century for
family residence, in the days when Bloomsbury was an aristocratic
quarter and great men lived in Leicester Square; but now, alas!
smoke-stained and time-dimmed, it was given over to the dust which the
law accumulates.  From its exterior, like those of its neighbours, there
protruded those great iron extinguishers used by the linkmen of days
bygone, while the broad, thin-worn stairs, easy of ascent, the solid
mahogany doors, the great carved handrail, and the fine Adams ceilings,
like those in the older houses of the Adelphi, told mutely of the
prosperity of its long-departed owners.

I had taken over the furniture, a frowsy lot of faded horsehair, which
had perhaps done duty there for half a century, together with the rooms,
and even though they were so dismal and out-of-date, I must confess that
they had one attraction for me, namely, that above, in the low-pitched
rooms on the top floor, there lived and worked my old college chum, Dick
Doyle, who had, after a good deal of wild-oat sowing, developed into a
rising journalist and _litterateur_.

Curious though it may appear, I had returned from the Sunny South and
taken up my abode in that dingy, dispiriting place with one sole idea,
namely, to be near the man who was practically my only friend in the
whole world.  I was in sore need of him, for I was utterly heedless of
everything past, present, or future.

With the exception of old Mrs Parker, who had served my family for
twenty years, I was absolutely alone and helpless as a child.  At the
age of twenty-five I had ceased to interest myself in anything, and
plunged in eternal gloom, all desire for life having left me, for
knowing that its joys could no longer be mine I was, even though in the
full possession of all my youthful vigour, mental faculties, and bodily
strength, actually looking forward to the grave.

The terrible truth must here be told.  The reader will, I feel
confident, sympathise.  While living abroad, travelling hither and
thither through the old Italian towns, where I delighted to roam in the
big white piazzas and through the crumbling palaces, every stone of
which spoke of a brilliant and historic past, I had been suddenly seized
by disease, and for three months lay tossing upon my bed in an English
pension in Florence, tended by two calm, sweet-faced sisters of charity,
with their grey-blue habits and great white linen head-dresses, which in
my hours of fever and delirium seemed always so clean and cool.  The two
great Italian professors who were called to me shook their heads,
believing that, even if they managed to save my life, it would be at a
loss of one of my senses.  In this, alas! they were not mistaken.  My
eyes became affected by sclerotitis, a severe inflammation of the
sclerotic.  Gradually my eyes, those most beautiful structures of the
human body which manifest in such small compass the great, the
unspeakable, the incomprehensible power of our Creator, grew dim.  My
sight was slowly but surely failing me.  I was recovering from my bodily
ailment to be attacked by the ophthalmic disease which the doctors had
all along feared.

I implored of them to do something to preserve my sight, but they only
dropped into my eye certain liquids from their little brown glass
phials, and regarded the effect gravely.  A great oculist from Rome came
to give his opinion.  I saw him but mistily, as though I were looking
through a dense fog; and he, too, told me that all that could be done
had already been done.

I arose from my bed a fortnight later stone blind.

With this terrible affliction upon me I returned to London with Dick
Doyle, who came out to Florence to fetch me home.  For me, life had no
further charm.  The beauties of the world which had given me so much
pleasure and happiness were blotted out for me for ever.  I lived now
only in an eternal darkness which by day, when the sun shone upon my
eyes, seemed to assume a dull dark red.  At first it struck me that
because my sight had been destroyed my personal appearance must have
altered, but Dick assured me that it had not.  No one, he declared,
could tell by looking at my eyes that they were actually sightless.

And so I, Wilford Heaton, lived in those dull old chambers in Essex
Street, in rooms that I had never seen.

You, who have sight to read these lines, can you imagine what it is to
be suddenly struck blind?  Close your eyes for a brief five minutes and
see how utterly helpless you become, how entirely dependent you are upon
others, how blank would be your life if you were always thus.

Dick gave to me all the time he could spare from his work, and would
come and sit with me to chat, for conversation with him was all that was
now left to me.  He described my rooms and my surroundings with the same
minuteness with which he wrote, and tried to interest me by relating
scraps of the day's news.  Yet when he was absent, away or at work in
his rooms above, I sat alone thinking for hours and hours, counting time
by the chiming of the clock of St Clement Danes.

So heavily did time hang upon my hands that at last I engaged a teacher
from the Blind School over in Lambeth, and with his books of raised
letters he used to visit me each day and teach me to read.  I was an apt
pupil, I suppose, yet there was something strangely grotesque about a
man who had already graduated recommencing to learn his alphabet like a
child.  Still, it saved me from being driven mad by melancholy, and it
was not long before I found that, by the exercise of pains, I could read
slowly the various embossed books, standard works manufactured for the
recreation of those unfortunates like myself, who would otherwise sit
eternally idle with their hands before them.  And not only did I learn
to read, but also to make small fancy baskets, work very intricate at
first, but which, on account of the highly developed sense of touch that
I had acquired in reading, soon became quite easy.

The long months of winter darkness went by; but to me, who could not see
the sun, what mattered whether the days were brilliant August or black
December?  Sometimes I went out, but not often.  I had not become
proficient in finding my way by aid of a stick.  I had practised a good
deal in my rooms; but for a blind man to go forth into the busy Strand
he must have perfect confidence, and be able to guide himself among the
bustling throng.  Therefore, on my airings I usually went forth upon
Dick's arm, and the extent of our wanderings was the end of the
Embankment at Westminster Bridge, or around those small ornamental
gardens which extend from the Charing Cross station of the Underground
Railway up to Waterloo Bridge.  Sometimes, on rare occasions, he would
take me to dine with him at the Savage Club, in Adelphi Terrace; and
men, easy-going Bohemians, whom I could not see, would warmly shake my
hand.  I heard their voices--voices of artists and _litterateurs_ whose
names were as household words--sat charmed by their merry gossip of
artistic "shop," laughed at their droll stories, or listened to one or
other of the members who would recite or sing for the benefit of his
"brother Savages."  Those evenings, spent amid the tobacco-smoke and
glass-jingling of the only Bohemia still existing in London, were the
happiest in all that dull, colourless, dismal life of sound and touch.

They were the only recreations left to me.  Truly mine was a tristful
life.

In April, after I had lived in that dingy den six months or more, Dick
came into my room one morning and made an announcement.  It was that he
had been commissioned by his paper to go as its correspondent with a
British punitive expedition on the North-West Frontier of India.

"You'll go, of course," I said, reflecting that such an offer meant both
advancement and profit.  He had long ago told me that a commission as
war correspondent was his greatest ambition.

"No, my dear old fellow," his deep voice answered in a tone more grave
than usual.  "I can't leave you alone."

"Nonsense!"  I ejaculated.  "I'm not going to allow you to fling away
such a good offer to remain with me.  No, you must go, Dick.  You'll be
back in three months at most, won't you?"

"Perhaps before," and his voice sounded low and strange.  "But really,
old fellow, I can't go and leave you helpless, like this."

"You'll go," I said decisively.  "Mrs Parker will look after me, and
three months will soon pass."

"No," he said.  "It's all very well, but you can't sit here month after
month, helpless as you are.  It's impossible."

"I shall amuse myself with my books and my basket-making," I answered.
Truth to tell, this announcement of his had utterly crushed me.  His
society was the only bright spot in my life.  If he left me I should be
entirely alone, cheerless and melancholy.  Nevertheless, when the sight
is destroyed the mind is quickened, and I reflected all that this offer
meant to him, and admired his self-denial and readiness to refuse it on
my account.

Therefore I insisted that he should go.  In the end he was persuaded,
and three days later left Charing Cross for India.

When he had gone I became hopelessly depressed.  In vain did I try to
interest myself in the embossed books, but they were mostly works which
I had read long ago, and in vain I toiled at basket-making until my
finger-tips were sore and aching.  Sometimes at evening Mrs Parker,
herself a sad scholar, would try and read a few of what she considered
the choicest morsels of the "extra special."  She read very slowly and
inaccurately, poor old soul, and many were the words she was compelled
to spell and leave me to solve their meaning.  Indeed, in those long
hours I spent by myself I sank lower and lower in dejection.  No longer
I heard Dick's merry voice saying--

"Come, cheer up, old chap.  Let me tell you all I heard to-day over at
the club."

No longer could I lean upon his arm as we descended that steep flight of
steps leading from the end of Essex Street to the Embankment; no longer
did I hear those playful words of his on such occasions--

"Take care, darling, or you'll fall."

Dear old Dick!  Now, when I reflected upon it all, I saw how in my great
affliction he treated me as tenderly as he could a woman.  Forlorn,
hypped, and heart-sick, I lived on from day to day, taking interest in
nothing, moping doleful and unmanned.

A single letter came from him, posted at some outlandish place in the
North-West.  It was read to me by old Mrs Parker, but as Dick was a sad
scribbler, its translation was not a very brilliant success.
Nevertheless, from it I gathered how deep were his thoughts of me, and
how eager he was to complete his work and return.  Truly no man had a
more devoted friend, and certainly no man was more in need of one.

As the days grew warmer, and I sat ever with the _taedium vitae_ upon
me, joyless and dispirited in that narrow world of darkness, I felt
stifled, and longed for air.  Essex Street is terribly close in July,
therefore, finding the heat intolerable, I went forth at evening upon
the Embankment with Mrs Parker, and, with my stick, practised walking
alone upon that long, rather unfrequented stretch of pavement between
the railings of the Temple Gardens and the corner of Savoy Street.

Try to walk a dozen paces as one blind.  Close your eyes, and tap
lightly with your stick before you as you walk, and see how utterly
helpless you feel, and how erratic are your footsteps.  Then you will
know how extremely difficult I found my first essays alone.  I walked
full of fear, as a child walks, stumbling, colliding, halting, and
afterwards waiting for my pitying old woman-servant to take my arm and
guide me in safety.

Yet evening after evening I went forth and steadily persevered.  I had,
in the days before the world became shut out from my gaze, seen men who
were blind guiding themselves fearlessly hither and thither among the
London crowds, and I was determined, in Dick's absence, to master the
means of visionless locomotion, so that I might walk alone for health's
sake, if for nothing else.  And so I continued, striving and striving.
When Mrs Parker had served my dinner, cutting it up for me just as one
places meat before a helpless infant, we went forth together, and for an
hour each evening I went out upon that wide expanse of the Embankment
pavement which formed my practice-ground.

Gradually, by slow degrees, I became proficient in guiding myself with
that constant tapping that marks a blind man's progress through the
black void which constitutes his own narrow joyless world.  At last,
after several weeks of constant practice, I found to my great delight
that I could actually walk alone the whole length of the pavement,
guiding myself by intuition when encountering passers-by, and continuing
straight on without stumbling or colliding with any object, a fact which
gave me the utmost satisfaction, for it seemed to place me beyond, the
need of a constant guide.  With this progress I intended to astound Dick
upon his return, and so gradually persevered towards proficiency.





THE BRACELET AND THE PALM.

August was dusty and blazing in London, and I felt it sorely in Essex
Street.  The frontier war dragged on its weary length, as frontier wars
always drag, and Dick was still unable to return.  His brilliant
descriptions of the fighting had become a feature in the journal he
represented.  On one of my short walks from end to end of that long even
strip of pavement a hand was suddenly placed upon my shoulder, and the
voice told me that it was Shadrack Fennell, a charming old fellow, who
had been a popular actor of a day long since past, and was now a
prominent "Savage," well known in that little circle of London Bohemia.
He walked with me a little way, and next evening called and spent an
hour over cigars and whisky.  He was the only visitor I had had in all
those months of Dick's absence.

A blind man has, alas! very few friends.

Once or twice, when the heat became insufferable in my close stuffy
rooms, I contemplated going to the country or to the sea.  Yet, on
reflection, I told myself bitterly that, being unable to see the
beauties of God's earth, I was just as well there moping in that gloomy
street, and taking my evening airing beside the Thames.

Therefore with all desire for life or enjoyment crushed from my soul, I
remained in London, going out each fine evening, sometimes with Mrs
Parker, and at others, with a fearlessness acquired by practice, I
carefully guided myself down the steep granite steps leading from Essex
Street to the Embankment, and then paced my strip of pavement alone.
But how tristful, dispiriting, and soul-sickening was that monotonous
world of darkness in which I eternally existed, none can know, only
those unfortunate ones who are blind themselves.

About half-past eight o'clock one breathless evening in mid-August, Mrs
Parker being unwell, I went forth alone for my usual stroll.  The
atmosphere was close and oppressive, the pavement seemed to reflect the
heat, and even along the Embankment there was not a breath of air.
Alone, plunged in my own thoughts--for the blind think far more deeply
than those whose minds are distracted by the sights around them--I went
on with those short steps that I had acquired, ever tapping with my
stick to discover the crossings.  I was afraid of no street traffic;
only of cycles, which, by reason of their silence, are veritable ogres
to the blind.

Almost unconsciously I passed beyond the limit of my regular track,
beneath a railway-bridge which I knew led from Charing Cross station,
and then straight on, with only a single crossing, until I came to what
seemed the junction of several roads, where I hesitated.  It was an
adventure to go so far, and I wondered where I was.  The chiming of Big
Ben, however, gave me a clue.  I was at the corner of Bridge Street, for
I felt the wall of the St Stephen's Club.  The turning to the left
would, I knew, take me over Westminster Bridge; to the right I could
cross Palace Yard and Broad Sanctuary, and so gain Victoria Street.
Before my affliction I knew well that portion of London around the
Houses of Parliament.  I decided, therefore, on keeping to the right,
and some one whom I know not kindly piloted me over the dangerous
crossing from the corner of Parliament Street, for such I judged it to
be from the cries of men selling the evening papers.  Again, three times
in succession, did sympathetic persons, noticing my helplessness as I
stood upon the kerb, take my arm and lead me across, but in these
constant crossings I somehow entirely lost my bearings.  I was, I knew,
in a long straight thoroughfare and by the iron railings before the
houses guessed it to be that road of flat-dom, Victoria Street.

Amused at my intrepidity, and congratulating myself upon having gone so
far alone, I kept on, knowing that even if I lost myself I had only to
call a passing hansom and be driven back to Essex Street.  Thus for
perhaps three-quarters of an hour I wandered on.  From a lad who helped
me over one of the crossings I learnt that I had passed Victoria
Station, and now appeared to be traversing several large squares--at
least, such was the impression conveyed upon my mind.  It was useless to
stop passers-by every moment to inquire where I was, therefore, laughing
inwardly at my situation, lost in London, the great city I had known so
well, I went on and on, down long straight thoroughfares that seemed
endless, in enjoyment of the first real walk I had taken since my
crushing affliction had fallen upon me.

Suddenly, in what seemed to be a quiet deserted street, I left the kerb
to cross the road alone, but ere I became aware of impending danger a
man's voice shouted roughly, and I found myself thrown by violent
concussion upon the roadway, struggling frantically beneath a horse's
hoofs.  I clutched wildly at air to save myself, but next second
received a violent kick on the left side of the head, which caused
sparks to appear before my sightless eyes, stunned me, and rendered me
almost instantly insensible.

How long I remained ignorant of things about me it is impossible to
tell.  I fancy it must have been a good many hours.  On my first return
to consciousness I heard strange confused sounds about me, low
whispering, the words of which were utterly unintelligible to my
unbalanced brain, and the quick rustling of silk.  I remember wondering
vaguely where I was.  The blind quickly develop a habit of extreme
caution, and with my senses dulled by the excruciating pain in my skull
I lay reflecting without speaking.  The throbbing in my head was
frightful.  When the recollections of my long walk which had ended so
disastrously surged through my brain, it struck me that I must have been
taken to a hospital after the accident, and that I had most probably
remained there some days.  Yet in hospitals there is no perfume of _peau
d'Espagne_, nor do the nurses wear silken flounces.

I tried to catch the words uttered by those about me, but in vain.  It
may have been that they were spoken in some foreign tongue, or, what is
much more likely, the terrible blow I had received from the horse's hoof
had utterly disarranged my sense of hearing.  This single thought
appalled me.  If my hearing had really been injured, then I was rendered
absolutely helpless.  To the blind the acoustic organs become so
sharpened that they can detect sounds where those in full possession of
sight and hearing can distinguish nothing.  It is the ear that acts for
the sightless eye.  Therefore the fear that even this had failed me held
me appalled.

I stretched forth my hand, and to my surprise felt that I was not in a
hospital bed, as I had at first believed, but upon a silken couch, with
my head resting upon a soft satin pillow.  The covering of the couch was
of rich brocade in wide stripes, while the woodwork had a smoothness
which caused me to believe that it was gilt.  I raised my hand to my
head, and found it bandaged with a handkerchief and some apparently
improvised compresses.

Although I opened my eyes, all was, of course, an utter blank before me.
Yet I felt instinctively, as every blind person does, the presence of
some one in my immediate vicinity, and presently, after long reflection,
I suddenly asked--

"Where am I?  What has happened?"

"You have been run over, and your head is injured," answered a strange
harsh voice, hoarse and altogether curious.  "But tell me.  Your eyes
have a curious look in them.  Can't you see?"

"No," I responded.  "Unfortunately I am totally blind."

"Blind!" gasped the voice, in apparent amazement.  "Then that accounts
for your accident!"

"But where am I?"  I inquired eagerly.

"You need not trouble, I assure you," answered the voice, pleasantly.
"You are with friends."

"Then I am not in a hospital?"

"Certainly not.  Having witnessed your accident, I am trying to do what
little I can for you."

The voice was low-pitched; and, further, it struck me as being
disguised.

"May I not know the name of my good Samaritan?"  I inquired.

"The name is entirely unnecessary," the voice responded.  "From your
card-case I see that your name is Heaton, and that you live in Essex
Street, Strand."

"Yes," I answered.

"How long have you been blind?" the voice inquired, hoarse and deep.  I
knew that it was disguised by certain of the syllables being pronounced
differently in various words.

"For a year or more," I answered.

"And does your head still pain you very much?" inquired the voice, while
at the same moment I felt a cool hand placed upon my throbbing brow.

In an instant I seized it by the wrist.  The hand tried to wrench itself
free, but not before I had felt the slimness of the fingers, the rings
upon them, and the softness of the palm.

It was a woman's.  She had cleverly disguised her voice to cause me to
believe that it was a man's.  I placed my right hand upon her arm and
felt it bare.  Upon her wrist was a curious bracelet, thin but strangely
pliable, evidently made of some ingeniously worked and twisted wire.

The arm was bare; her skirts were of silk.  My nurse was evidently in an
evening toilette.

"Although I cannot see you, madam, I thank you for your kind attention,"
I said, a trifle piqued that she should have endeavoured to mislead me
by her voice.

She drew her hand away quickly, with a slight cry, as though annoyed at
my discovery.

"I witnessed your accident," she explained simply, in a sweet,
well-modulated voice, evidently her own.  By her tone, she was no doubt
young, and I wondered whether she were pretty.

"How did it happen?  Tell me," I urged.

"You were crossing the road, and were knocked down by a cab.  My doctor
has already examined you, and says that you are not seriously hurt.  It
is a mere scalp-wound, therefore you may rest content, and congratulate
yourself upon a very narrow escape."

"I congratulate myself upon failing into the hands of a friend," I said.

"Oh, it is really nothing!" exclaimed my unknown hostess.  "In a few
hours you will, no doubt, be all right.  Rest, and in the morning the
carriage shall take you home."

"Then it is not yet morning?"  I inquired, vaguely wondering what hour
it might be.

"No, not yet."

The response sounded afar off, and I felt somehow that my strength was
suddenly failing me.  A heavy, drowsy feeling crept over me, and my mind
seemed filled with conflicting thoughts, until I fell asleep, the cool,
soft, sympathetic hand still upon my brow.

When I awoke it was with a refreshed feeling.  No one was, however, in
my immediate vicinity.  My kind protectress had left me, yet I heard
voices in conversation in the adjoining room.  The door communicating
was closed, but there was the unmistakable pop of a champagne-cork and a
jingling of thin glasses that told of festivity.  In whose house, I
wondered, was I a guest?  Already I had inquired, but had been refused
information.

Suddenly the voices were hushed, and I could distinguish a woman
saying--

"I tell, you he's blind--stone blind.  If you doubt me, hold that before
his face and see if he flinches."  A man's voice sounded in a low growl
in response, then all was silent again.  Only the ticking of a clock
somewhere near me broke the stillness.

Whispers, like low, suspicious exchanges of confidence, soon afterwards
reached my ears.  The door had opened silently, and a few seconds later
I felt the soft hand of my protectress again upon my forehead.  My
sightless eyes were wide open, and by that she, of course, knew that I
was awake.

"Are you better after your sleep?" the well-cultivated voice inquired
concernedly.

"Very much," I answered, raising myself upon my elbows.  "But I have
troubled you far too long, and will go, if you will kindly instruct your
servant to call me a cab."

"Oh dear no," the voice answered pleasantly.  "I couldn't think of
allowing you to go home at this hour, and in your weak state, too.  It
would be madness.  Continue your rest, and you will be quite right again
in the morning."

"You are extremely kind," I protested, "but I really couldn't think of
remaining longer."

"Would you like to repay me for what you so very generously term my
kindness?" she asked.  "If so, I would only ask one little favour."

"Certainly.  I will grant it if it lies within my power," I responded.

"Well, it is that you would scribble your name here, in this birthday
book of mine.  It will be a little souvenir of this evening."

"But I cannot write well nowadays.  I can't see, you know," I protested.

"But you can write your signature.  If the handwriting is uneven I will
forgive you, in the circumstances," the voice said merrily; and a moment
later she placed a pen with a handle of ivory or pearl within my hand.

"What day of the month?" inquired the sweet voice.

"The second of July," I answered, laughing; and my unknown friend,
having opened the book at that page, guided my hand to the paper,
whereon I scrawled my name.

She took both pen and book, and by the departing swish of her skirts I
knew that she had left me and had passed into the adjoining room.

A strange picture arose in my mind.  Was she beautiful?  At any rate her
surroundings were elegant, and her low musical voice was that of a young
and refined girl of twenty or so.

I listened, lying there helpless and sorely puzzled.  Again curious
whisperings in subdued tones sounded from beyond, but almost at that
same moment some one commenced to play upon the piano Chopin's
"Andante-Spinato," which prevented me from distinguishing either the
words uttered or the trend of the discussion.

For several minutes the sound of the piano filled the room, the touch,
light and delicate, seeming to be that of a woman, when, of a sudden,
there was a loud smashing of glass, and a woman's shrill, piercing
scream rang out, accompanied by the sound of some heavy object falling
to the floor.

In an instant the music ceased, and at the same moment I heard a man's
voice cry wildly--

"Good God!  You've--why, you've killed her!"

Next second there sounded a rapid scuffling of feet, a chair was
overturned and broken, and from the quick panting and muttered
ejaculations it seemed as though two persons had closed in deadly
embrace.  In their frantic, desperate struggle they advanced into the
room where I was, and I, still utterly helpless, with only a dark void
about me, raised myself in horror and alarm.  The man's words held me
appalled.

Some terrible tragedy had occurred.  My kind protectress had been
murdered.

The other two persons, whoever they were, fought fiercely quite close to
me, and I could distinctly detect from the vain efforts to shout made by
the weaker, that the stronger held him by the throat, and was
endeavouring to strangle him.

Of a sudden there was a quick, dull thud, the unmistakable sound of a
heavy blow, followed by a short agonised cry.

"Ah-h!" shrieked the voice of the person struck; and at the same instant
a great weight fell back inertly upon me as I was lying, nearly crushing
the breath from me.

I passed my sensitive hands over it quickly.  It was the body of a man.
Blood ran warm over my fingers.

He had been stabbed to the heart.





THE HOUSE WITH THE PORTICO.

The weight of the inert body oppressed me, and in striving to extricate
myself it slipped from the couch and slid to the ground; but such a
feeling of dread overcame me that I reached down and pushed the warm
body under the couch.

The faint sound of some one moving stealthily across the thick pile
carpet caused me to lie rigid, holding my breath.  I heard the movement
distinctly, and curiously enough it sounded as though it were a woman,
for there was just a faint rustling as though her skirts trailed upon
the ground.  My quick ear told me that the person was approaching.  By
the panting breath I knew that it was the assassin.  Was I, too, to fall
a victim?

I tried to call out, but in that moment of agony and horror my tongue
refused to articulate.  It seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth.

The sound of movement ceased, and I knew that the person was quite close
to me.  My eyes were wide open, held fixed in expectant horror.

I felt a warm breath upon my cheeks, and knew that the unknown assassin
was peering into my eyes.  In a few moments I had an instinctive feeling
of something being held a few inches from my face.

Then the words that had been spoken by my protectress recurred to me.
She had declared to her companions that I was blind, and urged them to
test me by holding something to my head.

This was now being done.  The truth of my statement was being proved,
possibly by a revolver being held to my brow.  If so, my only chance of
safety rested in unflinching coolness.  My position was certainly a most
unenviable one.

For a few moments the panting heart of the assassin thumped close to me;
then, apparently satisfied, the unknown person moved off in silence
without uttering a single word.

My first impulse was to jump up and arrest the progress of the assassin,
but on reflection I saw that to do so would only be to invite death.
What could I do, blind as I was?

Only could I sit and listen, trying to distinguish every detail of the
mystery.

Yes, I became convinced more than ever that the person leaving the room
was not a man--but a woman.

Could it be the same individual whose cool, sympathetic hand had only a
quarter of an hour before soothed my brow?  The thought held me
dumbfounded.

I had all along believed that the assassin had been a man, but it was
certain by that swish of silken flounces that it was a woman.

As I listened I heard the click of an electric-light switch at the door
of the room, and a couple of minutes later a heavy door closed.  From
the bang of the knocker I knew that the street door had been shut by
some person who had left the house.

I still sat listening.  All was silent.  Only the low ticking of the
clock broke the dead stillness of the night.  The mysterious woman who
had thus made her exit had evidently switched off the light, leaving me
in total darkness with the hideous evidences of her crime.

For some short time longer I listened, my ears open to catch every
sound, but, hearing nothing, I now knew that I was alone.  Therefore,
rising to my feet, I groped about until my hands touched the prostrate
body of the man, and as I did so he heaved a long sigh, and a quick
shudder ran through his frame.  The wound had evidently not caused
instant death, but, placing my hand quickly over the heart, I found that
it had now ceased its beating with the final spasm.

Slowly, and with utmost care, I passed both my hands over the dead man's
face, in order to obtain some mental picture of his appearance.  His
hair seemed thick and well parted at the side, his features those of a
young man shaven save for the moustache, which was long and well
trained.  He was in evening clothes, and wore in his shirt a single
stud, which, to my touch, seemed of very peculiar shape.  I tried to
make out its design, but in vain, when suddenly I remembered that if I
took it, it might afterwards give me some clue to its dead owner's
identity.  So I took it from the stiff shirt-front and placed it in the
pocket of my vest.

His watch-chain was an ordinary curb, I found, with a watch which had
the greasy feel of silver.  In his pockets were a couple of sovereigns
and some loose silver, but no letters nor card-case, nothing indeed to
lead me to a knowledge of who he really was.  In one pocket I found a
small pencil-case, and this I also took for my own purposes.

Half a dozen times I placed my hand upon his heart, whence the blood was
slowly oozing, but there was no movement.

My investigations showed that he was about twenty-eight years of age;
probably fair, by the softness of the hair and moustache, with even
teeth, rather sharp jawbones and cheeks a trifle thin.  Having
ascertained this much, I groped forward with both hands in the direction
of the room wherein the woman had been so swiftly done to death.  It was
in darkness, I have no doubt, but to me darkness was of no account, for
I was ever in eternal gloom.  The furniture over which I stumbled here
and there was covered with silk brocade, the woodwork being of that
smoothness which had led me to believe that it must be gilded.  It was
without doubt a fine spacious drawing-room where I had been lying, for
the dimensions of the place were quite unusual, and the objects with
which my hands came into contact were always of a character magnificent,
and in keeping with the grandeur of the place.  The house was evidently
one of those fine mansions with which the West End of London abounds,
and certainly this apartment, even though I could not see it, was the
acme of comfort and luxury.

I at last found the entrance to the adjoining room, but the door was
locked.

This sudden check to my investigations caused me to pause.  That a woman
had been first struck down by a cowardly blow appeared evident.  The
loud agonised shriek which had emanated from that inner room was, I felt
convinced, that of the tender, sweet-voiced woman who had administered
to my wants.  It seemed, now that I recollected, as though she had been
seated at the piano when the fatal blow was dealt.  The scream and the
cessation of the music had occurred simultaneously.

The theory impressed itself upon me that a woman was responsible for
both crimes.  It was a woman who had stood panting near me, who had
noiselessly tested me to ascertain whether I could distinguish objects
about me, and who had afterwards left the house.  My blindness had, no
doubt, saved my life.

Before leaving she had, for some unknown reason, locked the
communicating door and taken the key.  But upon the air, after she had
gone, there lingered the subtle fragrance of _peau d'Espagne_, the same
perfume used by the woman whose cool palm had soothed my brow.
Nevertheless, it seemed impossible that a woman could thus commit a
double crime so swiftly and with such force as to drive a knife to the
heart of a man and fling him back upon me--all in silence, without the
utterance of one single word.

With my eyes only a void of blackness, this mystery was bewildering, and
rendered the more tantalising by my inability to gaze about me.  I had
been present at the enactment of a terrible drama, but had not witnessed
it, and could not, therefore, recognise either culprit or victims.

Again I searched the great handsome room, in order to rivet all its
details upon my memory.  It had three long windows opening down to the
floor, which showed that it was situated in the back of the house,
otherwise they must have opened upon the street.  In one corner was a
pedestal, whereon stood a marble bust of a dancing-woman, like those I
had seen in the sculptor's at Pisa before the days of my darkness.
There were tables, too, with glass tops wherein, I supposed, were curios
and bric-a-brac, and before the great fireplace was stretched a
tiger-skin, with the paws preserved.

While groping there, however, my hand came into contact with something
which I found was a narrow, three-edged knife, so sharp that I cut my
finger while feeling it.  It had a cross-hilt, and the blade was thin
and triangular, tapering to a point.  The shape I knew to be Italian,
one of those Florentine stilettos used long ago in the Middle Ages, a
wound from which was almost certain to be fatal.  The Italians have long
ago brought the use of the knife to a fine art, and even to-day, murders
by stabbing are the most usual occurrences reported in their newspapers.
The blade of this antique weapon was about nine inches long, and the
handle velvet-covered and bound with wire, probably either gold or
silver.  The point was sharp as a needle.

My first impulse was to take possession of it; but, on reflection, I saw
that if I did so grave suspicion might possibly fall upon me.  I might
even be charged with the murder, especially as I had already in my
pocket the dead's man stud and pencil-case.  This thought caused me to
throw down the stiletto, and, continuing my search, I at length found
the door which gave egress to the place.

I opened it and stood in the hall to listen.  There was no sound.  The
stillness of the night remained quite unbroken, and I believed myself
alone with the dead.  By coughing, the echo of my voice showed that the
hall and staircase were wide and spacious.  Then it struck me that I had
no stick, without which I feared to walk; but, groping about, I found an
umbrella stand, and took therefrom a stout thorn, the handle of which
seemed smooth-worn by long usage.

What was my best course?  Should I go forth secretly, return home and
await the discovery of the terrible affair, which would no doubt be
fully reported in those evening newspapers which revel in crime?  Or
should I go out and inform the first constable I met?  The latter, I
saw, was my duty, and even though I had no desire to mix myself up in
such a mysterious and sensational affair, I resolved to go at once and
state all that I heard.

Whether the street door was situated to right or left I knew not, but
trying the right first, I found that the door was at the end of the
hall.  Opening it, I passed out, and having closed it again noiselessly
went down the five wide steps into the deserted street.

There were iron railings in front of the house, and before the door was
a big stone portico.  My hands told me both these details.

I turned to the left, and after walking some little distance crossed a
road and kept on down a long road which, although it did not appear to
be a main thoroughfare, seemed to run straight as an arrow.  For fully a
quarter of an hour I walked on without meeting a soul.  The only noise
that broke the quiet was the dismal howl of a dog, and now and then the
distant shriek and low roar of trains.  Suddenly I found myself in quite
a labyrinth of crooked streets, and after several turns emerged into
what I presumed to be one of the great arteries of London.

I stood listening.  The air was fresh, and it seemed to me that dawn was
spreading.  Afar I could hear the measured, heavy tread of a
police-constable, and hurried in his direction.  As I did so I put out
my stick and it struck some iron railings.  A few minutes later, in hot
haste, I overtook the man of heavy tread, and addressing him, said--

"Tell me, please, are you a constable?"

"Well, I believe I am," answered a rough voice, pleasantly withal.  "But
can't you see?"

"No, unfortunately I can't," I replied.  "Where am I?"

"Outside the South Kensington Museum.  Where do you want to go?"

"I want you to come with me," I said.

"With you.  What's up?"

"I've been present at a terrible tragedy," I blurted forth.  "Two people
have been murdered."

"Two people?" exclaimed the voice, quickly interested.  "Where?"

"In--in a house," I faltered, for not until that instant did the
appalling truth occur to me.  I had wandered away from the place, and
had no idea of its outward appearance, or in what road it was situated!

"Well, double murders don't often take place in the street, sonny.
But--" and the voice hesitated.

"Why, there's blood on your clothes, I see!  Tell me all about it.
Where's the house?"

"I confess that I've been foolishly stupid, for I've left it, and I
could never find my way back again.  I'm blind, you see, and I've no
idea of its exterior appearance."

"At any rate you've been near enough to the affair to get yourself in a
pretty mess," the rough voice said, somewhat suspiciously.  "Surely you
have some idea of where the affair took place?"

The situation was certainly the most curious in which any man could be
placed, for with only one thought in my mind, namely, to raise the
alarm, I had gone forth from the house of mystery and failed to mark it.
This negligence of mine might, I reflected, result in the affair being
hushed up for ever.  London is a big place in which to search for the
scene of a murder upon which my eyes had never gazed, and the details of
which I only knew by my sense of touch.  How many thousands of houses
there were in the West End each with its smoke-blackened portico and
little piece of area railing.

"No," I responded to the officer's inquiry.  "I was so bent upon giving
information that I forgot to place any mark upon the house by which to
know it again."

"Well, I've 'eard a good many funny stories while I've been on
night-duty in these eighteen years, but your yarn is about the rummest
of the lot," he said bluntly.

"I only know that the house is a large one, very well furnished, and has
a portico and railings in front--a double house, with hall in the
centre, and rooms on either side."

"That don't 'elp us very much, sonny," the voice observed.  "What's the
good o' running after me with a yarn like this if you can't take me to
the spot?  To judge from the state of your clothes, though, you've been
in some scrap or another.  If your coat was not covered with blood as it
is, I'd be inclined to put you down as a chap with a screw loose."

"I'm not demented, I tell you," I cried warmly.  "There's a terrible
crime been committed, and I have sought your assistance."

"And I'd go and have a look at the premises with you, if you could only
tell me where they are.  But as you can't--well, what are we to do,
sonny?"





THE WOMAN.

"Take me at once to the police-station," I said firmly.  "I must make a
statement to your inspector on duty."

"Not much good, is it, if you can't tell us where the affair took
place?" queried the man, impertinently.

"It is my duty to make the report, and the duty of the police to
investigate it," I answered, annoyed, for it seemed as though he doubted
me.

"That's a nasty cut on your hand," he remarked.  "How did you get it?"

"I cut it myself by accident with the knife."

"What knife?"

"The knife with which the murders were committed."

"And what were you doing with it?" inquired the constable, utterly
regardless of the strict police regulation which forbids an officer to
put any such questions.

"I found it," I replied.

"Where?"

"On the floor of the room, while I was searching about."

The man grunted dubiously.

I was well aware of the suspicion which must fall upon me, for I knew
there was blood upon my clothes, and that my story possessed a distinct
air of improbability.

"Who injured your head like that?" he asked.

In response, I told him how, in crossing a road, I had been knocked down
and rendered insensible by a cab, and how, on regaining consciousness, I
had found myself under the care of some woman unknown.

He gave vent to a short harsh laugh, as though discrediting my
statements.

"You don't believe me," I blurted forth hastily.  "Take me to your
inspector.  We must lose no time."

"Well, you know," observed the man, "your story, you'll admit, is a very
extraordinary one.  You say that a terrible affair has happened in a
house somewhere about here, yet you can't direct us to it.  The whole
story is so curious that I'm afraid you'll have a difficulty in
persuading anybody to believe you."

"If you don't, somebody else will," I snapped.  "Come, take me to the
police-station."

Thus ordered, the man rather reluctantly took my arm, and crossing the
wide main road, we traversed a number of short crooked thoroughfares.

"You don't seem a very good walker, mister," the constable observed
presently.  "I see a cab in the distance.  Would you like to take it?"

"Yes.  Call it," I said, for I felt very weak and ill after my terrible
night's adventure.

A few minutes later we were sitting together in the hansom, driving
towards the address he had given, namely, College Place Police-Station.

On the way I explained to him the whole of the facts as far as I could
recollect them.  He listened attentively to my curious narrative until I
had concluded, then said--

"Well, sir, it's certainly a most mysterious affair, and the only fear I
have is that everybody will look upon it with disbelief.  I know what I
should do if I were a gentleman in your place."

"What would you do?"

"Well, I should keep my knowledge to myself, say nothing about it, and
leave the revelation of the crime to chance."

"I am compelled to make a report of it, because I was present at the
tragedy," I said.  "It is my duty, in the interests of justice."

"Of course, that's all very well, I quite agree that your duty as a
citizen is to make a statement to my inspector, but if I may be
permitted to say so, my private opinion is, that to preserve a discreet
silence is better than making a fool of one's self."

"You're certainly plain-spoken," I said smiling.

"Oh, well, you'll excuse me, sir," the man said, half-apologetically.
"I mean no offence, you know.  I only tell you how I myself would act.
Now, if you could give any real information of value to the detectives,
there would be some reason for making the statement, but as you can't,
well you'll only give yourself no end of bother for nothing."

"But surely, man, you don't think that with the knowledge of this
terrible affair in my mind I'm going to preserve silence and allow the
assassin to escape, do you?"

"Well, it seems that the assassin has escaped already, in any case," the
man laughed.  "You take it from me that they were a cute lot in that
house, whoever they were.  The wonder is that they didn't kill you."

An exactly similar thought had crossed my mind.  The drive seemed a long
one, but at length the cab stopped, and we alighted.

I heard the conveyance turn and go off, as together we ascended the
steps of the station.  One thing struck me as curious, namely, that the
air was filled with a strong odour like turpentine.

"The station is a long way from your beat," I remarked.

"Yes.  A fairish way, but we're used to it, and don't notice the
distance."

"And this is College Place--is it?"

"Yes," he responded, conducting me down a long passage.  The length of
the corridor surprised me, and I humorously remarked--

"You're not going to put me in the cells, I hope?"

"Scarcely," he laughed.  "But if we did the darkness wouldn't trouble
you very much, I fear.  Blindness must be an awful affliction."

He had scarcely uttered these words ere we ascended a couple of steps
and entered what seemed to be a spacious place, the charge-room of the
police-station.

There was the sound of heavy tramping over bare boards, and suddenly a
rather gruff voice inquired--

"Well, four-six-eight?  What is it?"

"Gentleman, sir--wants to report a tragedy.  He's blind, sir."

"Bring him a chair," said the inspector's voice authoritatively.

My guide drew forward a chair, and I seated myself, saying--

"I believe you are the inspector on duty here?"

"Yes, I am.  Will you kindly tell me your name and address?"

I did so, and the scratching of a quill told me that he was about to
take down my statement.

"Well?" he inquired at length.  "Please go on, for my time is limited.
What's the nature of the affair?"

"I've been present to-night in a house where a double murder has been
committed," I said.

"Where?"

"Ah!  That's unfortunately just the mystery which I cannot solve.  Being
blind, I could obtain no idea of the exterior of the place, and in my
excitement I left it without properly marking the house."

"Tell me the whole of the facts," observed the officer.  "Who are the
victims?"

"A woman and a man."

"Young or old?"

"Both young, as far as I can judge.  At any rate, I examined the body of
the man and found him to be about twenty-eight."

"The gentleman has no idea of the street where the tragedy has
occurred," chimed in the constable.  "He met me outside the Museum, and
the blood on his clothes was still wet."

"He's got an injury to the head," remarked the inspector.

"I was knocked down and rendered insensible by a cab," I explained.
"When I again became conscious I found myself in a strange house."

"They didn't rob you?"

I felt in my pockets, but I could not discover that I had lost anything.
I remembered that I had only a couple of half-sovereigns and some loose
silver upon me, and this remained still in my pocket.  My fingers
touched the stud and pencil-case, and I hesitated whether to give these
up to the police.  But next second the thought flashed through my mind
that if I did, suspicion might be aroused against me, and further that
while I kept them in my possession I should possess a secret clue to the
victims of the terrible tragedy.

After I had fully explained the whole circumstances, and the inspector
had written down with infinite care each word of my remarkable
statement, he said--

"It seems as though both the man and woman fell victims to some plot or
other.  You say that there were no high words, and that all you heard
was a woman's shriek, and a man's voice say, `Why, you've killed her!'
Now, have you any idea of the identity of that man?"

"None whatsoever," I answered.  "My mind is a perfect blank on
everything, save the personal appearance of the man who was afterwards
struck to the heart."

"Exactly.  But don't you think that the man who expressed horror at the
first crime fell the victim of the second?"

"Ah!  I never thought of that!"  I said.  "Of course, it seems most
likely."

"Certainly.  The second crime was committed undoubtedly in order to
conceal the first."

"Then how extraordinary it is that I was spared."

"There was a motive, I believe, for that.  We shall no doubt find that
later."

"You will communicate with Scotland Yard, I suppose," I remarked.

"Perhaps we shall; perhaps not," answered the inspector, vaguely.  "The
affair must, of course, be fully investigated.  Have you anything to
add?  You say that some woman treated you kindly.  Have you any idea of
her personal appearance?"

"None," I answered.  "The only fact I know was that she was in evening
dress, and that upon her wrist was a curious smooth-worn bangle of a
kind of fine plaited wire, very pliable, like those worn by African
native women."

"Eh!  What--impossible!" gasped the inspector, in a voice which
surprised me.  But next moment he recovered his self-possession and made
a calm remark that this fact did not lead to anything definite.  Yet the
sudden exclamation of startled surprise which escaped him aroused within
me a belief that my words had given him some mysterious clue.

"You have no further statement to make?"

"None," I responded.

There was a few moments' silence during which time the quill continued
its rapid scratching.

"You will kindly sign your information," the officer said, whereupon the
constable brought me the sheet of foolscap and a pen wherewith I
scrawled my name.

"Good," observed the inspector, with a grunt of satisfaction.  "And now
I must ask you to excuse me further, Mr--Mr Heaton, and wish you good
morning."

I made my adieu, after obtaining from him a promise to communicate with
me if anything transpired, and, accompanied by the constable, made my
way out into the long passage again.

I had not walked a dozen paces ere I knew instinctively that some
persons were near me, and next instant felt myself seized roughly by
both arms and legs.

"What are you doing?"  I shouted in alarm; "let me go!"

But only for an instant I struggled.  The force used was utterly
irresistible, and not a single word was uttered.  My arms were in a
moment pinioned, rendering me helpless as a child.  With my terrible
affliction upon me, I could neither defend myself nor could I see my
assailants.  Whoever the latter were, it was evident that they were
determined, and, further, that I had been cleverly entrapped.

My first thought was that I had been arrested, but ere the lapse of a
few moments the hideous truth became impressed forcibly upon me.

I tried to fight for life, but my wrists had been seized in grips of
steel, and after a few desperate wrenches I stood, bound, and utterly
unconscious of where I was.

My real position was, to a certain degree, plain.  The man whom I had
believed to be a constable was no police-officer at all, but some thief
or London ruffian; I, far too confiding, had neglected to take the
precaution of feeling his uniform.

A shrewd suspicion overcame me that this trap had been purposely laid
for me.  The man who had posed as a police inspector had obtained from
me a signed declaration of the remarkable occurrence, for what reason I
knew not.  Did they now intend to silence me for ever?  The thought
struck a deep and terrible dread within my heart.

To my demands to know where I was, no response was given.

Indistinct whisperings sounded about me, and by the liquid "s's" of one
person I felt convinced that a woman was present.

Little time, however, was I given in which to distinguish my
surroundings, for two persons gripped my bound arms and drew me roughly
through a narrow door, across an uneven floor, and thence down a long,
crooked flight of stone steps.

From below came up a dank, mouldy smell, as of some chamber long
unopened, and suddenly there broke upon my quick ears the wash of water.

In that moment of mental agony the truth was rendered plain.  I was not
in a police-station, as I believed, but in some house beside the Thames,
and, moreover, I was descending to the water--going to my death.

Once again, as a last effort, I struggled and fought with the fierce
desperation begotten of terror, but in a moment the strong hands that
held me pushed me violently forward, and I then felt myself falling
helplessly from some dizzy height.  My head reeled, and weakened as I
already was, all knowledge of things became blotted out.

The touch of a cool, sympathetic hand upon my brow was the first thing I
subsequently remembered.  My arms had apparently been freed, and with a
quick movement I grasped the hand.  It was a woman's.

Was I dreaming?

I stretched forth my left hand to obtain some idea of my surroundings,
and found myself lying upon an uneven stone flooring that seemed covered
with the evil-smelling slime of the river.

With my right hand I touched a woman's firm, well-moulded arm, and to my
amazement my eager fingers came into contact with a bangle.  I felt it.

The hand, the arm, the bangle, the perfume of _peau d'Espagne_, all were
the same as those of the woman who had pitied me in my helplessness, and
had so tenderly cared for me in that mysterious, unknown house, wherein
the tragedy had afterwards occurred.

At first I lay speechless in wonderment, but when I found tongue I
spoke, imploring her to make explanation.  I heard her sigh deeply, but
to all my inquiries she remained dumb.





THE UNSEEN.

"Tell me," I demanded in my helplessness, of the mysterious woman at my
side, "what has happened?"

"Rise, and try whether you can walk," said the voice at last, sweet and
low-pitched, the same well-remembered voice that had spoken to me in
that unknown house of shadows.

I struggled and rose stiffly, assisted tenderly by her.  To my joy I
found that I could walk quite well.

"Thank God!" she gasped, as though a great weight had been lifted from
her mind.  "Thank God that I have found you.  The tide is rising, and in
half an hour you would have been beyond human aid."

"The tide!"  I repeated.  "What do you mean?"

"At high tide the river floods this place to the roof, therefore nothing
could have saved you."

"What place is this?"

The voice was silent, as though hesitating to reveal to me the truth.

"A place wherein, alas! more than one person has found his grave," she
explained at last.

"But I don't understand," I said eagerly.  "All is so puzzling.  I
believed that I was inside a police-station, whereas I had actually
walked into this mysterious and cleverly-prepared trap.  Who are these
people who are my enemies?--tell me."

"Unfortunately, I cannot."

"But you, yourself, are not one of them," I declared.

"I may be," answered the voice in a strange, vague tone.

"Why?"

"Ah! no, that is not a fair question to ask."

"But surely, you, who were so kind to me after my accident in the
street, will you desert me now?"  I argued.  Her failure to give me any
assurance that she was my friend struck me as peculiar.  There was
something extremely uncanny about the whole affair.  I did not like it.

"I have not said that I intend to leave you.  Indeed, from motives of my
own I have sought and found you; but before we go further I must obtain
from you a distinct and faithful promise."

"A promise--of what?"

There was a brief silence, and I heard that she drew a deep breath as
those do who are driven to desperation.

"The situation is briefly this," the voice said, in a tone a trifle
harsher than before.  "I searched for you, and by a stroke of good
fortune discovered where your unknown enemies had placed you, intending
that at high tide you should be drowned, and your body carried out to
sea, as others have been.  From this place there is only one means of
egress, and that being concealed, only death can come to you unless I
assist you.  You understand?"

"Perfectly.  This is a trap where a man may be drowned like a rat in a
hole.  The place is foetid with the black mud of the Thames."

"Exactly," she answered.  Then she added, "Now tell me, are you prepared
to make a compact with me?"

"A compact?  Of what nature?"  I inquired, much surprised.

"It will, I fear, strike you as rather strange, nevertheless it is, I
assure you, imperative.  If I rescue you and give you back your life, it
must be conditional that you accept my terms absolutely."

"And what are those terms?"  I inquired, amazed at this extraordinary
speech of hers.

"There are two conditions," she answered, after a slight pause.  "The
first is that you must undertake to make no statement whatever to the
police regarding the events of last night."

She intended to secure my silence regarding the tragedy.  Was it because
that she herself was the actual assassin?  I remembered that while I had
reclined upon the silken couch in that house of mystery this startling
suspicion had crossed my mind.  Was that same cool, sympathetic palm
that had twice soothed my brow the hand of a murderess?

"But there has been a terrible crime--a double crime committed," I
protested.  "Surely, the police should know!"

"No; all knowledge must be kept from them," she answered decisively.  "I
wish you to understand me perfectly from the outset.  I have sought you
here in order to rescue you from this place, because you have
unwittingly fallen the victim of a most dastardly plot.  You are blind,
defenceless, helpless, therefore all who have not hearts of stone must
have compassion upon you.  Yet if I rescue you, and allow you to go
forth again into the world, you may, if you make a statement to the
police, be the means of bringing upon me a catastrophe, dire and
complete."

Every word of hers showed that guilt was upon her.  Had I not heard the
swish of her skirts as she crept from the room after striking down that
unknown man so swiftly and silently that he died without a word?

"And if I promise to remain mute?"

"If you promise," she said, "I will accept it only on one further
condition."

"And what's that?"

"One which I know you will have some hesitation in accepting; yet, like
the first, it is absolutely imperative."

Her voice showed traces of extreme anxiety, and the slim hand upon my
arm trembled.

She was young, I knew, but was she beautiful?  I felt instinctively that
she was, and conjured up within myself a vision of a refined face,
perfect in its tragic beauty, like that of Van Dyck's Madonna that I had
seen in the Pitti Palace at Florence in those well-remembered days when
I looked upon the world, and it had given me such pleasure.

"Your words are very puzzling," I said gravely.  "Tell me what it is
that you would have me do."

"It is not difficult," she answered, "yet the curious character of my
request will, I feel, cause you to hold back with a natural caution.  It
will sound strange; nevertheless, here, before I put the suggestion
before you, I give you my word of honour, as a woman who fears her God,
that no undue advantage shall be taken of your promise."

"Well, explain what you mean."

"The condition I impose upon you in return for my assistance," she said,
in deepest earnestness, "is that you shall promise to render assistance
to a person who will ever remain unknown to you.  Any requests made to
you will be by letter bearing the signature A-V-E-L, and these
instructions you must promise to obey without seeking to discover either
motive or reason.  The latter can never be made plain to you, therefore
do not puzzle yourself unnecessarily over them, for it will be all to no
purpose.  The secret--for secret there is, of course--will be so well
guarded that it can never be exposed, therefore if you consent to thus
rendering me a personal assistance in return for your life, it will be
necessary to act blindly and carry out to the letter whatever
instructions you receive, no matter how remarkable or how illogical they
may seem.  Do you agree?"

"Well," I said hesitatingly, "your request is indeed a most
extraordinary one.  If I promise, what safeguard have I for my own
interests?"

"Sometimes you may, of course, be compelled to act against your own
inclinations," she admitted.  "I, however, can only assure you that if
you make this promise I will constitute myself your protectress, and at
the same time give you solemn assurance that no request contained in the
letters of which I have spoken will be of such a character as to cause
you to commit any offence against the law."

"Then it is you yourself who will be my anonymous correspondent?"  I
observed quickly.

"Ah, no!" she answered.  "That is, of course, the natural conclusion;
but I may as well at once assure you that such will not be the case."
Then she added, "I merely ask you to accept or decline.  If the former,
I will ever be at your service, although we must never meet again after
to-day; if the latter, then I will wish you adieu, and the terrible fate
your unknown enemies have prepared for you must be allowed to take
effect."

"But I should be drowned!"  I exclaimed in alarm.  "Surely you will not
abandon me!"

"Not if you will consent to ally yourself with me."

"For evil?"  I suggested very dubiously.

"No, for good," she answered.  "I require your silence, and I desire
that you should render assistance to one who is sorely in need of a
friend."

"Financial aid?"

"No, finance has nothing to do with it.  The unknown person has money
and to spare.  It is a devoted personal assistance and obedience that is
required."

"But how can one be devoted to a person one has neither seen nor known?"
I queried, for her words had increased the mystery.

The shrewd suspicion grew upon me that this curious effort to secure my
silence was because of her own guilt; that she intended to bind me to a
compact in her own nefarious interests.

"I am quite well aware of the strangeness of the conditions I am
imposing upon you, but they are necessary."

"And if I accept them will the mystery of to-night ever be explained?"
I inquired, eager to learn the truth.

"Of that I know not," she answered vaguely.  "Your silence is required
to preserve the secret."

"But tell me," I said quickly, "how many persons were there present in
that house beside yourself?"

"No, no!" she ejaculated in a tone of horror.  "Make no further inquiry.
Try and forget all--everything--as I shall try and forget.  You cannot
know--you will never know--therefore it is utterly useless to seek to
learn the truth."

"And may I not even know your identity?"  I inquired, putting forth my
hand until it rested upon her well-formed shoulder.  "May I not touch
your face, so as to give me an impression of your personal appearance?"

She laughed at what, of course, must have seemed to her a rather amusing
request.

"Give me permission to do this," I urged.  "If there is to be mutual
trust between us it is only fair that I should know whether you are
young or old."

She hesitated.  I felt her hand trembling.

"Remember, I cannot see you," I went on.  "By touch I can convey to my
mind an impression of the contour of your features, and thus know with
whom I am dealing."

"Very well," she said at last.  "You have my permission."

Then eagerly, with both my hands, I touched her face, while she stood
rigid and motionless as a statue.  I could feel by the contraction of
the muscles that this action of mine amused her, and that she was
laughing.

Her skin was soft as velvet, her lashes long, her features regular and
finely cut like those of some old cameo.  Her hair was dressed plainly,
and she had about her shoulders a large cape of rich fur--sable I
believed it to be.  There was no doubt she was young, perhaps not more
than twenty-one or so, and certainly she was very handsome of
countenance, and dressed with an elegance quite unusual.

Her mouth was small, her chin pointed, and her cheeks with a firm
contour which spoke of health and happiness.  As I carefully passed my
hands backwards and forwards, obtaining a fresh mental impression with
each movement, she laughed outright.

Of a sudden, however, she sprang aside quickly, and left me grasping at
air.

"Ah!" she cried, wildly horrified at a sudden discovery.  "There is
blood upon your hands--_his blood_!"

"I had forgotten," I apologised quickly.  "Forgive me; I cannot see, and
was not aware that my hands were unclean."

"It's too terrible," she gasped hoarsely.  "You have placed those
stained hands upon my face, as though to taunt me."

"With what?"  I inquired, breathlessly interested.

But she did not reply.  She only held her breath, while her heart beat
quickly, and by her silence I felt convinced that by her involuntary
ejaculation she had nearly betrayed herself.

The sole question which occupied my thoughts at that moment was whether
she was not the actual assassin.  I forgot my own critical position.  I
recollected not the remarkable adventures that had befallen me that
night.  I thought not of the ghastly fate prepared for me by my unknown
enemies.  All my thoughts were concentrated upon the one problem--the
innocence or guilt of that unseen, soft-spoken woman before me.

"And now," she said at last--"now that you have satisfied yourself of my
personal appearance, are you prepared to accept the conditions?"

"I confess to having some hesitation in doing so," I answered, quite
frankly.

"That is not at all surprising.  But the very fact of your own
defencelessness should cause you to ally yourself with one who has shown
herself to be your protectress, and seeks to remain your friend."

"What motive can you possibly have for thus endeavouring to ally
yourself with me?"  I inquired, without attempting to disguise my
suspicion.

"A secret one."

"For your own ends, of course?"

"Not exactly.  For our mutual interests.  By my own action in taking you
in when you were knocked down by the cab I have placed your life in
serious jeopardy; therefore, it is only just that I should now seek to
rescue you.  Yet if I do so without first obtaining your promise of
silence and of assistance, I may, for aught I know, bring an
overwhelming catastrophe upon myself."

"You assure me, upon your honour as a woman, that no harm shall befall
me if I carry out the instructions in those mysterious letters?"

"If you obey without seeking to elucidate their mystery, or the identity
of their sender, no harm shall come to you," she answered solemnly.

"And regarding the silence which you seek to impose upon me?  May I not
explain my adventures to my friend, in order to account for the blood
upon my clothes and the injury to my head?"

"Only if you find it actually necessary.  Recollect, however, that no
statement whatever must be made to the police.  You must give an
undertaking never to divulge to them one single word of what occurred
last night."

There was a dead silence, broken only by the lapping of water, which had
already risen and had flooded the chamber to the depth of about two
inches.  The place was a veritable death-trap, for, being a kind of
cellar and below high-water mark, the Thames flood entered by a hole
near the floor too small to permit the escape of a man, and would rise
until it reached the roof.

"Come," she urged at last.  "Give me your undertaking, and let us at
once get away from this horrible place."

I remained silent.  Anxious to escape and save my life, I nevertheless
entertained deep suspicions of her, because of her anxiety that I should
give no information to the police.  She had drawn back in horror at the
sight of the blood of the murdered man!  Had she not, by her hesitation,
admitted her own guilt?

"You don't trust me," she observed, with an air of bitter reproach.

"No," I answered, very bluntly; "I do not."

"You are at least plain and outspoken," she responded.  "But as our
interests are mutual, I surely may presume to advise you to accept the
conditions.  Life is better than death, even though one may be blind."

"And you hold back from me the chance to escape from this slow but
inevitable fate unless I conform to your wishes?"

"I do."

"Such action as yours cannot inspire confidence."

"I am impelled by circumstances beyond my own control," she answered,
with a momentary touch of sadness.  "If you knew the truth you certainly
would not hesitate."

"Will you not tell me your name?"

"No.  It is useless."

"At least, you can so far confide in me as to tell me your Christian
name," I said.

"Edna."

"And you refuse your surname?"

"I do so under compulsion."

The water had by this time risen rapidly.  My legs had become benumbed,
for it now reached nearly to my knees.

"Why do you longer hesitate?" she went on.  "Give me your word that you
will render the assistance I require, and we will at once escape.  Let
us lose no time.  All this seems strange to you, I know; but some day,
when you learn the real reason, you will thank me rather than think ill
of my present actions."

Her determination was, I saw plainly, the outcome of some terror which
held her fettered, and I knew that, in order to save myself, I must give
her the promise she had so persistently desired to extract from me.

Therefore, with sudden determination, prompted by the natural, instinct
of self-preservation than by any desire to assist her, I gave her my
bond of secrecy.

Again she sighed deeply, as though released of some oppressive weight by
my words.  Then our hands clasped in mutual trust, and without further
word she led me to the opposite side of the noisome cellar into which my
enemies had cast me.

"You shall never regret this decision," she assured me in a strained
voice, trembling with emotion--"never, never!"

And with a sudden movement she raised my hand and touched it lightly
with her dry, fevered lips.





HAND AND HEART.

This impulsive action of hers was as though she were deeply indebted to
me.  I stood motionless in wonderment.

But only for an instant.  She left my side for a moment, and from the
sound that escaped her lips appeared to be struggling to open some means
of egress from the place.

"Remain where you are," she said, "and I will return to you in a moment.
The way out is rather difficult, and I shall be compelled to assist
you."  Her voice sounded above me, as though she had somehow climbed to
the roof of the place.

I heard the drawing of a bolt and the clang of iron; then she climbed
down again to where I anxiously awaited her.  The river flood had risen
alarmingly, and was still entering rapidly.

"Come, let me guide you," she said, taking my arm and leading me to the
wall.  "Lift your foot, so!" and taking my foot, she placed it in a kind
of narrow step in the rough stone wall, at the same time placing my hand
upon a piece of iron that seemed to be a large nail driven into the
masonry.  "Now climb very carefully," she went on.

Without hesitation, I raised myself from the ground slowly, and with
infinite care commenced to scale the wall, while she remained below,
wading almost up to her waist in water.

"Take care that you don't strike your head," she cried warningly.
"Above you is a small hole just large enough for you to get through.  Be
very careful, and take your time."

The one hand at liberty I stretched above my head, and found, as she
described, a square hole in the roof of the place, and, grasping the
stone, I eventually managed to escape through it, finding myself at last
standing upon a boarded floor.

A few moments later she was again at my side, and by the clang of iron I
knew that the aperture of that fatal place was closed again.

I inquired of her where we were, but she only replied--

"I've already explained to you that to seek to elucidate the mystery of
these adventures of yours is entirely useless.  We have promised to each
other mutual faith.  That is, in itself, sufficient."

Then, taking my arm, she hurriedly led me across the room, up some
steps, and along two long passages that ran at right angles to each
other, until at length we emerged into the street.

Where we were I had not the slightest idea.  I only knew that we were
beside the river bank, for upon my ears there fell the shrill whistle of
a steam-tug.

With her arm linked in mine, and heedless of the water dripping from her
skirts, she led me forward through a number of narrow turnings, until by
the bustle about me I knew that we must have reached a main road.

I heard the approaching hoot of a taxi, and the vehicle, at her demand,
pulled up at the kerb.

"We must now part," she said, in a low, earnest voice.  "Remember that
in this remarkable affair our interests are absolutely identical.  Any
order that you receive you will obey without seeking to discover the why
or wherefore, and above all, silence to the police."

"I have promised," I answered.

"And whatever may occur in the future, recollect that I am still your
protectress, as I have been to-day.  I have forced you to your promise,
but for that I ask your forgiveness, because it is essential, if the
mystery is ever to be solved."

"Are you, too, seeking the truth?"

"Yes," she responded.  "But we must not talk here.  The condition of our
clothes is attracting attention."

"I shall think always of the mysterious Edna who refuses all
information," I laughed.

"And I, too, shall not easily forget you--and all I owe to you.
Farewell."

Her soft hand grasped mine for an instant, that same cool hand that had
soothed my brow.  Afterwards she assisted me into the cab.

"Good-bye," she cried.  Then she became lost to me.

I told the driver where to go, and sat back in the vehicle, plunged in
my own thoughts.  I was like a man in a dream.  The mystery was most
tantalising.  Feeling weak, I stopped at a public-house and had some
brandy.  Indeed, I felt so unwell that I sat in the bar-parlour fully
half an hour before resuming my drive.

Suddenly I recollected that I might gather something from the driver,
and I inquired where he had taken me up.

"In Albert Road, Battersea, sir."

This surprised me, for I had no idea that I had been on the Surrey side
of the river.

I explained to the man my blindness, and asked him to describe the lady
who had put me into this cab.

"Well, sir," he said, "she was very pretty indeed, with grey eyes and
darkish hair."

"She was good-looking--eh?"

"Yes, sir.  I don't think I've ever seen a much prettier young lady."

I sighed.  How tantalising it was that my poor sightless eyes had been
unable to gaze upon her.

"Describe her more closely," I urged.  "I'm anxious to know exactly what
she's like."

"She had lovely eyes, sir.  Her hair seemed a bit untidy, but it was a
pretty shade of dark-brown.  Her face seemed innocent-looking, like a
child's.  I was surprised to see her like that."

"Like what?"

"Half-drowned like.  She had on a black skirt that seemed soaking wet
through, and covered with mud.  She looked in an awful plight, and yet
her face was merry and smiling.  She took another cab as soon as she
parted from you, and drove after us across the Albert Bridge, and then
down Oakley Street.  There she stopped the cab to speak to some one."

"Who was it?"  I asked eagerly.

"A woman.  But I couldn't see distinctly.  They were too far away, and
turned down Cheyne Walk, so I didn't see 'em any more."

"You say that her clothes were very dirty?"

"Yes, worse than yours, and, great Scott! sir, they're bad enough.
You'll want to send 'em to the cleaners when you get 'ome."

What the man said was perfectly true.  The slime of the river emitted a
sickening stench, but it fortunately served to conceal one thing,
namely, the blood-stains upon my coat.

I laughed at this remark of his, but I had no intention to enter upon
explanations.

"From her appearance did my companion lead you to believe that she was a
lady?"

"Oh yes, sir.  By her manner you'd tell her as a lady among ten
thousand."

"There was nothing noticeable about whereby I might recognise her again?
Try and recollect."

"No, sir," answered the man.  "She was a very beautiful young lady, and
that's all I noticed."

"You'd know her again if you saw her?"

"I should just say I would," laughed the man.  "When a chap sees a woman
as lovely as she is it ain't likely he'll forget her, even though he may
have a wife and 'arf a dozen kids at 'ome."

"You're smitten by her beauty, it seems," I laughed.  "What's your
name?"

"West, sir--Tom West.  Number L.C.432.  I stand on the rank at Hyde Park
Corner."

"Well, West," I said, taking a card out of my case, and handing it to
him, "if you ever see that lady again, and can find out who and what she
is, and where she lives, I'll give you a present--say twenty pounds."

"Twenty quid!" the man echoed with a whistle.  "I'd like to touch the
oof, sir, and you bet I'll keep my weather eye open."

"As soon as you've found her, let me know, and the money is yours.  You
understand that's a bargain."

"Right you are, sir.  I'll do my very best."

"If you only knew the driver of the cab she took after we parted you
might, perhaps, learn something."

"That's just what I'm thinking," he said.  "The man who drove her was, I
believe, an old fellow that we know as `Doughy' but I'm not at all sure.
However, as soon as I set you down I'll go and find him.  A driver is
difficult to recognise if he wears another overcoat, you see.  That's
why I'm not certain that it really was `Doughy'."

By the sharp descent of the roadway I knew that we were already in Essex
Street, and a few moments later I had paid the man West and was
ascending the stair to my own chambers.

The enlistment into my service of this man, the only person who had seen
the mysterious Edna, was, I congratulated myself, a very shrewd and
clever commencement of the investigation which I intended, at all
hazards, to carry out.

Indeed, my only means of tracing her was through the intermediary of
this one man, who had seen her and remarked upon her marvellous beauty.
He seemed a sharp, witty fellow, and I therefore entertained every
confidence in his efforts to earn the promised reward.  He was now on
his way to find his colleague, the old driver "Doughy," and if Edna had
actually taken his cab I should, without doubt, soon be in possession of
some information.

Thus, with a light step and reassured feeling, I ascended the stairs,
wondering what old Mrs Parker would say to my protracted absence, and
how I should explain it to her.  I took out my latch-key and opened the
door.

As I entered the tiny lobby that served the dual purpose of hall and a
place in which to hang coats, a startling sound broke upon my ears--the
sound of a woman's cry.

In an instant I drew back.  Fresh mystery greeted me.  I stood there
rigid, speechless, aghast.





THE MYSTERY IS INCREASED.

The voice which greeted me was that of a woman surprised by my sudden
entrance; and walking swiftly forward to investigate, I passed into my
own dingy sitting-room.

"I have a visitor, it seems," I exclaimed, stopping short.  "May I not
know your name?"

There was no response.  Instinctively I knew that the woman I had thus
disturbed was still present in that room wherein I spent so many lonely
hours.  Her startled cry was sufficient to convince me that she was
there for some secret purpose.  What, I wondered, could it be?

"Speak," I urged.  "Kindly explain your business with me, and the reason
of your presence here."

Yet she uttered no word of response, and apparently did not move.

I advanced, crossing towards the window, where I believed she must be
standing, but with a quick movement my mysterious visitor eluded me,
passing me by so near that her warm breath fanned my cheek, and next
instant she had escaped and slammed the outer door of my chambers.

I stood wondering.  Her presence there was most extraordinary.  The
faithful Parker, too, was absent, a circumstance which aroused
misgivings within me.  Could this strange female visitor have entered
the place with a false key; or was she a mere pilferer whom I had
disturbed in her search for plunder?  Numbers of female thieves haunt
the London streets, and it seemed more than likely that she was one who
had ascended the stairs on pretence of selling something or other.

At any rate, I had returned at an unexpected moment, or she would not
have given vent to that involuntary cry of dismay.  I groped about the
familiar room in order to ascertain whether it were disordered, but
could find nothing whatsoever out of place.  I called Parker loudly by
name, but all was silence save the quick ticking of the timepiece upon
the mantelshelf.

The clock of St Clement Danes chimed merrily, then slowly struck the
hour.  I counted, and found that it was eleven o'clock in the morning.
How much had happened during the past fifteen hours!  I had twice nearly
lost my life.

Having cast aside my hat, I sank into my armchair, muddy and dirty, just
as I was.  My head, where it had been struck in the accident, pained me
considerably, and I felt that I had a touch of fever coming on.  Yet all
my thoughts were concentrated upon the future and what the curious
alliance with my strange protectress might bring upon me.  Surely no man
had ever found himself in a more remarkable situation than I was at that
moment; certainly no man could be more mystified and puzzled.  Deeply I
pondered again and again, but could make nothing of that tangled web of
startling facts.

By no desire or inclination of my own I had fallen among what appeared
to be very undesirable company, and had involuntarily promised to become
the assistant of some person whom I could not see.  The strange
oppression that fell upon me seemed precursory of evil.

My wet clothes sticking to me chilled me to the bone, and, with a sudden
resolve to shake off the gloomy apprehensions that seemed to have
gripped my heart, I rose and passed into my own room to wash and get a
change of clothing.

The prolonged absence of Parker caused me much wonder.  She never went
out unless to go into the Strand to purchase the diurnal steak or
tri-weekly chop which constituted my chief sustenance; or, perhaps, on
Sunday afternoon she would, on rare occasions, go "to take a cup o' tea"
with her daughter, who was a music-hall artiste, and lived somewhere off
the Kensington Road.

Having cleaned myself, I proceeded to dress the wound on my head, my own
medical knowledge standing me in good stead, and when I had
satisfactorily bandaged it and put on a dry suit of clothes, I groped
about through the several small rooms which were my home.  Nothing
seemed disarranged, nothing missing--only the woman who had ever been so
faithful to me and had treated me as tenderly in my helplessness as
though I had been her own son.

In impatience I took a cigar, lit it, and sat down to wait.  No doubt,
when she returned I should find that she had been absent upon some
errand connected with her not-over-extensive _cuisine_.  The thought
grew upon me that my promise to the mysterious Edna, whoever she might
be, was a rashly foolish one, and must result in some very serious
_contretemps_ for me.  I had willingly given up my liberty of action and
become the instrument of a person who had, without doubt, imposed upon
me.  It seemed most probable, now that I reflected, that she was acting
in concert with the man who had so cleverly practised deception upon me
and led me to believe that he was a police-constable.  That man, it now
seemed plain, had followed me from the house of mystery, allowed me to
wander sufficiently far to lose my bearings, and then got on in front of
me so that I might approach and accost him.  The whole affair had been
carried out with amazing ingenuity, and every precaution had apparently
been taken to conceal the remarkable tragedy.  Yet the chief feature of
the affair which puzzled me was the motive in endeavouring to take my
life in that cellar beside the Thames.  I had surely harmed no one, and,
being utterly ignorant of the house wherein the affair had taken place,
and also knowing me to be blind, they certainly could not fear any
revelations that I might make.  It was an enigma which I strove in vain
to solve.

My gloomy thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the sound of a latch-key
in the outer door, and as I rose old Mrs Parker entered with an
expression of profound surprise.

"Why, sir?" she cried.  "I understood that you'd gone away into the
country!"

"Into the country?"  I echoed.  "Who told you so?"

"The lady you sent to tell me."

"Lady?  What lady?"  I inquired, amazed.  "Surely, Parker, you've taken
leave of your senses?"

"The lady came about an hour ago, sir, and said that you had sent her to
tell me that you would be absent for perhaps a week or so--that you had
gone down to your uncle's in Hampshire."

"I've sent no one," I responded, astounded at this fresh phase of the
affair.  "What kind of lady was she--old or young?"

"Middle-aged."

"Well-dressed?"

"Yes, sir.  She spoke with a funny kind of lisp, which made me think she
might be a foreigner.  She said she knew you quite well, being a friend
of your aunt's, and that you were travelling down to Hampshire this
morning, your uncle having been taken ill.  I remarked that it was
strange that you shouldn't come home for your bag and things, but she
gave me a message from you to send a bag packed with your clothes by
train from Waterloo to Christchurch Station marked `To be called for.'"

"But didn't you think her story a very lame one, Parker?"  I asked,
angry that my old serving-woman should have thus been misled and
deceived.

"Of course I did, sir, especially as you were absent all night.  I told
her that, and she said that you had called upon her, and finding your
aunt, Lady Durrant, there on a visit, remained to supper.  While at
supper a telegram had arrived summoning your aunt home, as your uncle
had been taken dangerously ill, and at once you had resolved to
accompany her.  But you've hurt your head, sir, haven't you?" she added,
noticing my bandages.

"Yes," I answered.  "I fell down.  It is nothing--my own carelessness."

The story was, to say the least, a most ingenious one.  Whoever the
mysterious woman was she apparently knew that my uncle, Sir Charles
Durrant, lived in the neighbourhood of Christchurch; that he was at that
moment in a very critical state of health, suffering from paralysis, and
further, that I had considerable expectations from him, and would not
hesitate to travel down to see him if I knew him to be worse.  One
thing, therefore, was quite plain, namely, that my family affairs were
perfectly well known to these persons whose movements were so
mystifying.

"It was foolish of you, Parker, very foolish indeed, to have given
credence to such an absurd tale as that," I said, annoyed.  "You are
usually a shrewd woman, but you have displayed no discretion in this
affair--none whatever."

"I'm very sorry, sir," the woman answered.  "But I knew that if Sir
Charles were worse you'd go down to the Manor at once.  Did you really
send nobody, sir?"

"No; nobody at all.  There's some underhand business in all this,
Parker, so keep your wits about you."

"And haven't you seen her ladyship at all, sir?" she inquired, in her
turn astonished.

"No, and, moreover, I know nothing of this mysterious woman who came to
you with this cock-and-bull story.  Did she say where she lived, or give
any card?"

"No, she didn't, sir."

"I suppose you'd know her again if you saw her?"

"Well," she answered with considerable hesitancy, "I don't know as I
should, sir.  You see, she wore one of them white lace veils which makes
it difficult to distinguish the features."

"But what object could any one have in coming to you and telling a
falsehood in that manner?"  I cried, my anger increased by the knowledge
of Parker's inability to again recognise the bearer of the false
message.

"I don't know, I'm sure, sir," was the woman's reply, in a voice which
showed how deeply she regretted the occurrence.

"How long was she here?"  I inquired.

"About five minutes.  She asked me to let her see your sitting-room and
the reading-books with the embossed letters, as she was much interested
in you, and had heard so much of you from Lady Durrant."

"And you showed them to her?"

"Yes, sir."

"Then you had no right to do so without my permission, Parker," I said
angrily.  "You are an old and trusted servant, and should have known
better."

"I'm very sorry, sir.  The truth was that she seemed such a well-spoken
lady, and her manner was so perfect that I thought you would not like to
offend her."

"Recollect that if any other persons call they are not to enter my rooms
on any pretext," I said decisively.

"Very well, sir.  I acknowledge that I was entirely in the wrong in
allowing her to pry about the place."

"And when she had gone?"

"Then I went over to the butcher's in the Strand to get a bit of steak."

"And saw nothing more of her?"

"Yes, sir.  I did see her again.  As I was coming back I met her in the
Strand, at the corner of Arundel Street, walking with a gentleman who
looked like a City man.  She said something to him, and he turned and
had a good look at me."

"Then it must have been this same woman who was in my chambers here when
I returned," I said.

"A woman here?" she ejaculated.

"Yes; when I entered there was a woman here, and she escaped as though
she were a thief.  She must have gone out and rejoined the man, who was
awaiting her somewhere in the vicinity.  That would bear out the fact
that you encountered her again."

"But how could she get in?  I'm always careful to see that the door is
properly closed."

"Probably she stole the extra latch-key while prying about the place.
See whether it is still on the nail."  She crossed the room, and next
moment gasped--"It's gone, sir!"

"Ah!"  I said.  "Just as I thought!  The story she told you was a mere
excuse to obtain admittance to the place, and, if possible, to get
possession of the key.  This she obtained, and, having watched you out,
returned and continued her search for something she desired to secure.
We must at once examine the whole place, and seek to discover what's
been stolen."

"Do you think she was a common thief, sir?" inquired Parker, dumbfounded
by the ingenuity with which the latch-key had been secured.

"I don't know what to believe at present," I answered.  "We must
investigate first, and form our conclusions afterwards.  Now, make a
thorough search and see what has been disturbed and what is missing."

I had no intention of entering into a long explanation with Parker
regarding the events of that fateful night, or to disturb her peace of
mind by relating any of the tragic circumstances.  Therefore, I went to
my room and locked away my muddy, blood-stained clothing, and afterwards
returned, and with my hands felt the various objects in my sitting-room,
to assure myself that none was displaced or missing.





THE STRANGER.

The visit of this mysterious woman in the white lace veil--at that time
a fashionable feminine adornment--was, I felt assured, more than a
coincidence.  That it had some connexion with the strange events of the
past night seemed certain, yet, try how I would, I could form no
definite idea of either the motive of the visit or the object of her
search.  As far as Parker could discover, nothing whatever had been
taken.  A writing-table, the drawers of which contained some family
papers, had apparently been hastily examined, but no object of value,
nor any paper, had been extracted.  Therefore I concluded that I had
returned before the intruder had had time to make the complete
examination of my effects which she had intended.

A curious thought occurred to me.  Was the intruder in the white veil
none other than the mysterious Edna herself?

As the day wore on I became more and more impressed by the belief that
my surmise was the actual truth.  Yet the cabman West had declared that
she was young and pretty, while Parker expressed herself positive that
she was middle-aged.  But of the two statements I accepted that of the
cabman as the more reliable.  He had seen her in the broad daylight
without the veil.

The fact of her concealing her features in a species of fine
window-curtain proved an attempt at disguise, therefore what more likely
than that she should contrive to render her features older, and thus
impose upon Parker, whose sight was not over good?  In any case,
however, if it were really Edna, she had certainly lost no time in
carrying out her design, and further, she must have been fully aware of
my intended return.

Days passed, hot blazing days and stifling nights, when the dust of
throbbing, ever-roaring London seemed over my heart.  Each morning, with
Parker's assistance, I searched the newspapers, but nothing appeared to
show that that strange midnight crime had been discovered.  Were there
two victims, or only one?  How strange it was that although I had been
present I could not tell I only knew that the male victim was young and
well-dressed, probably a gentleman, and that he had been stabbed by a
cowardly blow which had proved almost instantly fatal.  That woman's
scream that had sounded so shrill and agonised in the dead stillness of
the night I remembered plainly as though it were but an hour ago--
indeed, I remember it now as distinctly as ever.  Was it the cry of Edna
herself?

In my helplessness I could do nothing but remain silent, and keep my
terrible secret to myself.  Unable either to communicate with the police
or seek the assistance of my friend, I found that any endeavour to seek
a solution of the problem was mere sowing of the wind.  My thoughts hour
by hour, as I sat alone in my dingy room, my poor blind eyes a black
void, were of the ghastly affair, and in all its phases I considered it,
trying to find some motive in the subsequent actions of the unscrupulous
persons into whose hands I had had the misfortune to fall.

I heard of Dick through the office of his journal.  He was down with
fever at some outlandish place on the Afghan frontier, and would
certainly not be home for a couple of months or so.

At first I was puzzled how to get rid of my soiled and blood-stained
clothes so that Parker should not discover them, and at last hit upon
the expedient of making them into a bundle and going forth one night
when she was over at Kennington with her daughter Lily, the
dancing-girl, and casting them into the Thames from the Embankment.  It
was a risky operation, for that part of London is well guarded by police
after dark; nevertheless I accomplished it in safety, and was much
amused a few days later by reading in an evening paper that they had
been found near London Bridge and handed over to the river police, who,
of course, scented a mystery.  The blood-stains puzzled them, and the
journal hinted that Scotland Yard had instituted inquiries into the
ownership of the discarded suit of clothes.  The paragraph concluded
with that sentence, indispensable in reporting a mystery, "The police
are very reticent about the matter."

Fortunately, having cut out the maker's name, and taken everything from
the pockets which might serve as a clue to ownership, I felt perfectly
safe, and eagerly read the issue of the same journal on the following
evening, which told how the stains had been analysed, and found to be
those of human blood.

A little more than a week had passed since my remarkable midnight
adventure, when one morning I received a brief note by post, which
Parker read to me.  It consisted of only two typewritten lines stating
that at mid-day I would receive a visitor, and was signed with the
strange word "AVEL."

It was, I knew, a message from Edna, and I dressed myself with greater
care in expectation that she herself would visit me.  In this, however,
I was disappointed, for after existing some three hours on tiptoe with
anxiety I found my visitor to be a well-spoken, middle-aged man, whose
slight accent when introducing himself betrayed that he was an American.

When we were alone, with the door closed, he made the following
explanation--

"I have called upon you, Mr Heaton, at the request of a lady who is our
mutual friend.  You have, I presume, received a letter signed `Avel'?"

"Yes," I said, remembering how that I had promised to blindly and
obediently render my protectress whatever assistance she desired.  "I
presume you desire some service of me.  What is it?"

"No," he said.  "You are mistaken.  It is with regard to the terrible
affliction from which I see you are suffering that I have been sent."

"Are you a medical man?"  I inquired, with some astonishment.

"I am an oculist," was his reply.

"And your name?"

"Slade--James Slade."

"And you have been sent here by whom?"

"By a lady whose real name I do not know."

"But you will kindly explain, before we go further, the circumstance in
which she sought your aid on my behalf," I said firmly.

"You are mutual friends," he answered, somewhat vaguely.  "It is no
unusual thing for a patient to seek my aid on behalf of a friend.  She
sent me here to see you, and to examine your eyes, if you will kindly
permit me."

The man's bearing irritated me, and I was inclined to resent this
enforced subjection to an examination by one of whose reputation I knew
absolutely nothing.  Some of the greatest oculists in the world had
looked into my sightless eyes and pronounced my case utterly hopeless.
Therefore I had no desire to be tinkered with by this man, who, for
aught I knew, might be a quack whose sole desire was to run up a long
bill.

"I have no necessity for your aid," I answered, somewhat bluntly.
"Therefore any examination is entirely waste of time."

"But surely the sight is one of God's most precious gifts to man," he
answered, in a smooth, pleasant voice; "and if a cure is possible, you
yourself would, I think, welcome it."

"I don't deny that," I answered.  "I would give half that I possess--
nay, more--to have my sight restored, but Sir Leopold Fry, Dr Measom,
and Harker Halliday have all three seen me, and agree in their opinion
that my sight is totally lost for ever.  You probably know them as
specialists?"

"Exactly.  They are the first men in my profession," he answered.  "Yet
sometimes one treatment succeeds where another fails.  Mine is entirely
and totally different to theirs, and has, I may remark, been successful
in quite a number of cases which were pronounced hopeless."

Mere quackery, I thought.  I am no believer in new treatments and new
medicines.  The fellow's style of talk prejudiced me against him.  He
actually placed himself in direct opposition to the practice of the
three greatest oculists in the world.

"Then you believe that you can actually cure me?"  I remarked, with an
incredulous smile.

"All I ask is to be permitted to try," he answered blandly, in no way
annoyed by my undisguised sneer.

"Plainly speaking," I answered, "I have neither inclination nor
intention to place myself at your disposal for experiments.  My case has
been pronounced hopeless by the three greatest of living specialists,
and I am content to abide by their decision."

"Oculists are liable to draw wrong conclusions, just as other persons
may do," he remarked.  "In a matter of this magnitude you should--permit
me to say so--endeavour to regain your sight and embrace any treatment
likely to be successful.  Blindness is one of man's most terrible
afflictions, and assuredly no living person who is blind would wish to
remain so."

"I have every desire to regain my sight, but I repeat that I have no
faith whatever in new treatment."

"Your view is not at all unnatural, bearing in mind the fact that you
have been pronounced incurable by the first men of the profession," he
answered.  "But may I not make an examination of your eyes?  It is, of
course, impossible to speak with any degree of authority without a
diagnosis.  You appear to think me a charlatan.  Well, for the present I
am content that you should regard me as such;" and he laughed as though
amused.

He seemed so perfectly confident in his own powers that I confess my
hastily formed opinion became moderated and my prejudice weakened.  He
spoke as though he had detected the disease which had deprived me of
vision, and knew how to successfully combat it.

"Will you kindly come forward to the window?" he requested, without
giving me time to reply to his previous observations.  I obeyed his
wish.

Then I felt his fingers open my eyelids wide, and knew that he was
gazing into my eyes through one of those glasses like other oculists had
used.  He took a long time over the right eye, which he examined first,
then having apparently satisfied himself, he opened the left, felt it
carefully, and touched the surface, of the eyeball, causing me a twinge
of pain.

"As I thought!" he ejaculated when he had finished.  "As I thought!  A
slight operation only is necessary.  The specialists whom you consulted
were wrong in their conclusions.  They have all three made an error
which is very easy to make, yet it might have deprived you of sight for
your whole life."

"What!"  I cried, in sudden enthusiasm.  "Do you mean to tell me
solemnly that you can perform a miracle?--that you can restore my sight
to me?"

"I tell you, sir," he answered quite calmly, "that if you will undergo a
small operation, and afterwards subject yourself to a course of
treatment, in a fortnight--or, say three weeks--you will again open your
eyes and look upon the world."

His words were certainly startling to me, shut out so long from all the
pleasures of life.  This stranger promised me a new existence, a world
of light and movement, of colour, and of all the interests which combine
to make life worth living.  At first I was inclined to scorn this
statement of his, yet so solemnly had he uttered it, and with such an
air of confidence, that I became half convinced that he was more than a
mere quack.

"Your words arouse within me a new interest," I said.  "When do you
propose this operation?"

"To-morrow, if you will."

"Will it be painful?"

"Not very--a slight twinge, that's all."

I remained again in doubt.  He noticed my hesitation, and urged me to
submit.

But my natural caution asserted itself, and I felt disinclined to place
myself in the hands of one of whose _bona fides_ I knew absolutely
nothing.

As politely as I could I told him this, but he merely replied--

"I have been sent by the lady whom we both know as Edna.  Have you no
confidence in her desire to assist you?"

"Certainly I have."

"She has already explained to me that you have promised to carry out her
wishes.  It is at her urgent request that I have come to you with the
object of giving you back your sight."

"She wishes me to submit to the experiment?"

"Pardon me.  It is no experiment," he said.  "She desires you to submit
yourself to my treatment.  If you do, I have entire confidence that in a
week or so you will see almost as well as I do."

I hesitated.  This stranger offered me the one great desire of my life--
the desire of every person who is afflicted with blindness--in return
for a few moment's pain.  Edna had sent him, prefaced by the mysterious
letter signed "Avel."  It was her desire that I should regain my sight;
it was my desire to discover her and look upon her face.

"If I find your name in the _Medical Register_ I will undergo the
operation," I said at last.

"To search will be in vain," he responded, in the same even tone.

"Then your name is assumed?"

"My practice is not a large one, and I have no need to be registered,"
he said evasively.

His words again convinced me that he was a mere quack.  I had cornered
him, for he was palpably confused.

"As I have already told you," I said, with some warmth, "your attempts
at persuasion are utterly useless.  I refuse to allow my eyes to be
tampered with by one who is not a medical man."

He laughed, rather superciliously I thought.

"You prefer your present affliction?"

"Yes," I snapped.

"Then, now that you force me to the last extremity," he said firmly, "I
have this to present to you."

And next moment I felt within my hand a paper neither the nature of
which, nor the writing thereon, could I distinguish; yet from his voice
I knew instinctively that this stranger, whoever he was, held triumph
over me.





FROM THE UNKNOWN.

"I have no knowledge of what this is," I said, puzzled, holding the
paper he had given me.

"Then I will read it to you," he responded; and taking it from my hand,
he repeated the words written there.  Even then I doubted him, therefore
I took the paper into the kitchen and bade Parker read it.  Then I knew
that he had not deceived me, for Parker repeated the very same words
that he had read, namely--

  "The first request made to you, Wilford Heaton, is that you shall
  repose every confidence in Doctor Slade, and allow him to restore your
  sight.  Obey.

  "Avel."

The note was very brief and pointed, written, I learnt, like the first
note, with a typewriter, so that no clue might be afforded by the
calligraphy.  It was an order from the unknown person whom I had
promised to blindly and faithfully obey.  At the time I had given the
mysterious Edna that promise I was in deadly peril of my life.  Indeed,
the promise had been extracted from me under threat of death, and now,
in the security of my own home, I felt very disinclined to conform with
the wishes of some person or persons whom I knew not.  I saw in what a
very serious position I had placed myself by this rash promise, for I
might even be ordered to commit a crime, or, perhaps, for aught I knew,
have unwittingly allied myself with some secret society.

The one desire which ever possessed me, that of being able to look upon
the unseen woman with the musical voice, who had at one time been my
protectress and my captor, urged me, however, in this instance, to
accede.  There was evidently some object in making this attempt to give
me back my sight, and if it really succeeded I alone would be the
gainer.

Understand that I had no faith whatever in the stranger who had thus
come to me with a promise of a miraculous cure; on the other hand, I
felt that he was a mere charlatan and impostor.  Nevertheless, I could
not be rendered more blind than I was, and having nothing to lose in the
experiment, any gain would be to my distinct advantage.

Therefore, after further argument, I very reluctantly promised to allow
him to operate upon me on the morrow.

"Good," he answered.  "I felt sure that your natural desire for the
restoration of your sight would not allow your minor prejudices to stand
in the way.  Shall we say at noon to-morrow."

"Any hour will suit me," I answered briefly, with a rather bad grace.

"Then let it be at noon.  I and my assistant will be here by
eleven-thirty."

"I should prefer to come to your surgery," I said, with the idea of
obtaining some knowledge of the stranger's address.  If I knew where he
lived I could easily find out his real name.

"That is, unfortunately, impossible," he answered blandly.  "I am
staying at an hotel.  I do not practise in London."

He seemed to have an ingenious answer always upon the tip of his tongue.

So, after some further conversation, in which he continually foiled any
attempt I made to gain further knowledge of Edna or of himself, he rose
and bade me adieu, promising to return on the morrow with the necessary
instruments.

With a rather unnecessary show of punctuality he arrived next day,
accompanied by a younger, sad-voiced man, and after some elaborate
preparations, the nature of which I guessed from my own medical
knowledge, I sat in my big armchair, and placed myself entirely at his
disposal.  From the first moment that he approached me and examined me
prior to producing anaesthesia of the part to be operated upon I knew
that my prejudice had been hastily formed.  He was no quack, but
careful, confident, and skilled, with a firm hand evidently used to such
cases.

To fully describe what followed can be of no interest to any save
medical men, therefore suffice it to relate that the operation lasted
about an hour, after which my eyes were carefully bandaged, and my
attendant and his assistant left.  Slade called each day at noon, and
carefully dressed my eyes, on each occasion expressing satisfaction at
my progress, but always impressing upon me the absolute necessity for
remaining with the blinds closely drawn, so that no ray of light should
reach me.  Darkness did not trouble me, yet Parker found it rather
difficult to serve my meals in the gloom, and was very incredulous
regarding the mysterious doctor's talents.  She viewed the whole affair
just as I had once done, and, without mincing words, denounced him as a
quack, who was merely running up a long bill for nothing.

For nearly three weeks I lived with the Venetian blinds of my
sitting-room always down, and with a thick curtain drawn across them,
shutting out all light, as well as a good deal of air, until the summer
heat became stifling.  Hour after hour I sat alone, my hands idly in my
lap, ever wondering what the success of this experiment would be.
Should I ever again see, after those grave and distinct pronouncements
of Fry and the rest, who had plainly told me that my sight was for ever
destroyed?  I dared not to hope, and only remained inert and thoughtful,
congratulating myself that I had at least obeyed the dictum of my
mysterious and unknown correspondent, under whose influence I had so
foolishly placed myself.

At last, however--it was on a Sunday--Slade came, and as usual raised
the bandages and bathed my eyes in a solution of atropine.  Then, having
made a careful examination, he went to the window, drew aside the
curtains, and slightly opened the Venetian blinds.

In an instant I cried aloud for joy.

My sight had been restored.  The desire of my life was an accomplished
fact.  I could actually see!

Dimly I could distinguish his short, burly form between myself and the
faint light of the half-opened blinds, but even though all was as yet
misty and indistinct, I knew that what had been averred was the actual
truth--the specialists had been mistaken.  With care and continued
treatment my sight would strengthen until I became like other men.

"I can see!"  I cried excitedly.  "I can see you, doctor--and the
light--and the blinds!"

"Then you acknowledge that what I told you was the truth--that I did not
lie to you when I told you that your case was not beyond recovery?"

"Certainly.  You told me the truth," I said hastily.  "At the time it
seemed too improbable, but now that you have shown me proof, I must ask
your pardon if any words of mine have given you offence."

"You've not offended me in the slightest, my dear sir," he answered
pleasantly.  "Persevere with the treatment, and continue for another few
days in darkness, and then I feel confident that a perfectly
satisfactory cure will have been effected.  Of course, we must not
expect a clear vision at once, but by degrees your sight will slowly
become stronger."

And with those words he closed the blinds and drew the curtain close, so
that the room was again darkened.

Imagine the thankfulness that filled my heart!  It was no illusion.  I
had actually seen the narrow rays of sunlight between the half-opened
blind and the dark silhouette of the short, stout, full-bearded man who
was effecting such a marvellous cure.

I gripped his hand in the darkness, and thanked him.

"How can I sufficiently repay you?"  I said.  "This service you have
rendered me has opened up to me an absolutely new life."

"I desire no repayment, Mr Heaton," he answered in his deep, hearty
voice.  "That my treatment of malignant sclerotitis is successful, and
that I have been the means of restoring sight to one of my fellow-men,
is sufficient in itself."

"But I have one question I wish to ask you," I said.  "The mode in which
you were introduced to me is extremely puzzling.  Do you know nothing of
the lady named Edna?"

"I know her--that is all."

"Where does she live?"

"I regret that I am not able to answer your question."

"You are bound to secrecy regarding her?"

"I may as well admit the truth--I am."

"It's extraordinary," I ejaculated.  "Very extraordinary!"

"Not so extraordinary as the recovery of your vision," he observed.
"Remain perfectly quiet, and don't take upon yourself any mental
problems.  A great deal now depends upon your own calmness."

The fact that my sight was gradually returning to me seemed too
astonishing to believe.  This man Slade, whoever he was, had performed a
feat in surgery which seemed to me miraculous.

Again and again I thanked him, but when he had gone and I told Parker
she only gave vent to a grunt of incredulity.  Yet had I not actually
seen the silhouette of Slade, and the streaks of sunlight beyond?  Had I
not already had ocular proof that a cure was being effected?

What would Dick, dear old Dick, say on his return when he found me
cured?  I laughed as I pictured to myself his amazement at finding me at
the railway-station on his arrival--looking for him.

Through a whole month Slade came regularly each day at noon, and surely,
by slow degrees, my vision became strengthened, until at length I found
that, even though I wore smoke-darkened glasses, I could see almost as
well as I had done in the days of my youth.  The glasses destroyed all
colour, it was true, yet I could now go forth into the busy Strand,
mingle with the bustling crowds, and revel in their life and movement.
Indeed, in those first days of the recovery of my vision I went about
London in taxis and omnibuses, hither and thither, with all the
enthusiasm of a country cousin or a child on his first visit to the
Metropolis.  All was novel and interesting on my return to a knowledge
of life.

Slade, I found, was a gentlemanly fellow with the air of a clever
physician, but all my efforts to discover his abode proved unavailing,
and, moreover, just as the cure was complete he one day failed to call
as usual.  Without word he relinquished me just as suddenly as he had
come; but he had restored to me that precious sense which is one of
God's chief gifts.

In those September days, when all the world seemed gay and bright, I
went forth into the world with a new zest for life.  I took short trips
to Richmond and Hampton Court, so that I might again gaze upon the green
trees, the winding river, and the fields that I loved so well; and I
spent a day at Brighton, and stood for a full couple of hours watching
the rolling sea beating upon the beach.  Six weeks before I was a
hopeless misanthrope, whose life had been utterly sapped by the
blighting affliction upon me.  Now I was strong and healthy in mind and
in body; prepared to do anything or to go anywhere.

It was a fancy of mine to go down to the home of my youth, Heaton Manor,
a place well known to those acquainted with the district around
Tewkesbury.  The great old mansion, standing in the centre of a wide,
well-wooded park that slopes down to the Severn close to the Haw Bridge,
had long been closed, and in the hands of the old servant Baxter and his
wife.  Indeed, I had never lived there since, on my father's death, it
had passed into my possession.  The rooms were opened for my inspection,
and as I wandered through them and down the long oak-panelled gallery,
from the walls of which rows of my time-dimmed ancestors, in their
ruffles, velvets, and laces looked down solemnly, a flood of
recollections of my sunny days of childhood crowded upon me.

Seven years had passed since my last visit there.  The old ivy covered
manor was, indeed, dilapidated, and sadly out of repair.  The furniture
and hangings in many of the rooms seemed rotting with damp and neglect,
and as I entered the nursery, and was shown my own toys, it seemed as
though, like Rip Van Winkle, I had returned again to life after a long
absence.

Alone, I wandered in the park down the avenue of grand old elms.  The
wide view across the brimming river, with Hasfield Church, and the old
Tithe Barn at Chaceley standing prominent in the landscape, had, I saw,
in no way changed.  I looked back upon the house--a grand old home it
was, one that any man might have been proud of, yet of what use was it
to me?  Should I sell it?  Or should I allow it to still rot and decay
until my will became proved, and it passed into the hands of my heirs
and assigns?

I felt loth to part with it, for the old place had been built soon after
the fierce and historic battle had been fought at Tewkesbury, and ever
since Richard Heaton had commanded one of the frigates which went forth
to meet the Armada, it had been the ancestral home of the Heatons.

How strange it all was!  At every turn I peered upon the world through
my grey glass spectacles, and took as keen an interest in it as does a
child.  All seemed new to me; my brain, like a child's, became filled
with new impressions and fresh ideas.  After my dull, colourless
existence of sound and touch, this bright life of movement filled me
with a delight that pen cannot describe.  Imagine, however, what joy it
is to one who has been pronounced incurably blind to look upon the world
again and taste of its pleasures.  It was that joy which gave lightness
to my heart.

Yet over all was one grim shadow--the remembrance of that fateful night
with its grim tragedy.  Who was Edna?  Where was she?  What was she?

Through her instrumentality I had regained my sight, but her identity
and her whereabouts still remained hidden, as she had plainly told me
they would be before we had parted.

Hither and thither I went, feted and feasted by my friends at the
Savage, the Devonshire, and other clubs, yet my mind was ever troubled
by the mystery of the woman who had, from motives that were entirely
hidden, exerted herself on my behalf, first in saving my life from
unscrupulous assassins, and, secondly, in restoring my vision.

I entertained a strong desire to meet her, to grasp her small hand, to
thank her.  I longed to see her.





THE GIRL IN BLUE.

The man who abandons all hope is constantly haunted by fears.  This is
as strange as it is unjust, like much else in our everyday life.  Even
though there had returned to me all the joys of existence, yet I was
still haunted by an ever-present dread--a terror lest some terrible
mandate should suddenly be launched upon me by the unknown director of
my actions.

My situation was, to say the least, a most extraordinary one.  Valiantly
I strove to rid myself of the obsession which constantly crept upon me
whenever my attention was not actually distracted by the new existence
that had so mysteriously been opened up to me.  For a little while I
would let my mind dwell upon the terrifying thought that I was entirely
helpless in the hands of one who was, without doubt, unscrupulous.  I
had pledged my honour to keep secret that appalling midnight crime, and
to act always as directed.  Edna herself, the woman whose voice sounded
so tender, whose hands were so small and soft to the touch, had forced
me to this.  To her alone was due this state of constant anxiety as to
what might next be demanded of me.  The thought would creep upon me, now
pausing, now advancing, until at length it wrapped me round and round,
and stifled out my breath, like a death-mask of cold clay.  Then my
heart would sink, my sight seemed to die, even sound would die until
there seemed an awful void--the void of death for ever and for ever
dumb, a dreadful, conquering silence.

A thousand times I regretted that I had in that moment of my utter
helplessness given my promise to conceal the mysterious crime.  Yet,
when I recollected with what extraordinary ingenuity I had been deceived
by the man whom I had believed to be a police-constable, the deep
cunning which had been displayed in obtaining from my lips a statement
of all the facts I knew, and the subsequent actions of the cool-headed
Edna, my mind became confused.  I could see no solution of the
extraordinary problem, save that I believed her to be deeply implicated
in some plot which had culminated in the murder of the young man, and
that she herself had some strong personal motive in concealing the
terrible truth.

With the return of my vision my sense of hearing had, curiously enough,
become both weakened and distorted.  Sounds I had heard when blind
presented quite a different impression now that I could see.  The blind
hear where those with eyesight can detect nothing.  The ears of the
former train themselves to act as eyes also, yet the moment the vision
is recovered the sharpened sense of hearing again assumes its normal
capacity.  Hence I found that I could not distinguish voices and sounds
so quickly as before; indeed, the voices of those about me sounded some
how different now I had recovered my sight.

My friends, into whose circle they declared I had returned like one from
the grave, welcomed me everywhere, and I confess that, notwithstanding
the oppression constantly upon me, I enjoyed myself to the top of my
bent.  I still remained in my dingy, smoke-grimed rooms in Essex Street,
really more for Parker's sake than for my own, and also, of course, in
order to be near Dick when he returned, but nearly every evening I was
out somewhere or other, going here and there about town.

In the middle of October, when most men I knew were away on the moors, I
had a dinner engagement one evening with the Channings, in Cornwall
Gardens.  Colonel Channing, a retired officer of the Guards, was a man I
had known during greater part of my lifetime.  His service had been
mainly of a diplomatic character, for he had served as British military
_attache_ at Berlin and Vienna, and now lived with his wife and daughter
in London, and seemed to divide his time mainly between the St James's
and the United Service Clubs.  He was a merry old fellow, with white
hair and moustache and a florid complexion, the dandified air of
_attache_ still clinging to him.

As he sat at the head of his table, his habitual monocle in his eye, and
the tiny green ribbon of the order of the Crown of Italy in the lapel of
his dining-jacket, he looked a perfect type of the _ex-attache_.  His
wife, a rather spare woman of fifty, who seemed to exist externally in a
toilette of black satin and lace, was pleasant, though just a trifle
stiff, probably because of her long association with other diplomatists'
wives; while Nellie Channing was a happy, fair-haired girl, who wore
pretty blouses, motored, golfed, flirted and shopped in the High Street
in the most approved manner of the average girl of South Kensington.

Nellie and I had always been good friends.  She had been at school in
England while her parents had been abroad, but on completing her
education she had lived some five years or so in Vienna, and had thus
acquired something of the cosmopolitan habit of her father.  She looked
charming in her pink blouse, a trifle _decollete_, as she sat on my left
at dinner, and congratulated me upon my recovery.

If, however, Nellie Channing was pretty, her beauty was far eclipsed by
that of my neighbour on my right, a tall, dark-haired girl in blue, a
Miss Anson, who with her mother, a quiet, white-haired elderly lady,
were the only other guests in addition to myself.  From the moment we
were introduced I saw that Mrs Anson's daughter possessed a face that
was absolutely perfect, rather oval in shape, with large, beautiful
eyes, that seemed to shine as they looked upon me, and to search me
through and through.  Her complexion was good, her cheeks well-moulded,
her mouth small and perfectly formed; her teeth gleamed white ever and
anon as she smiled at the Colonel's humorous remarks, and her nose was
just sufficiently tip-tilted to give her countenance a piquant air of
coquetry.

Her costume, rich and without any undue exaggeration of trimming or
style, spoke mutely of the handiwork of a first-class _couturiere_.  The
shade of turquoise suited her dark beauty admirably, and the bodice, cut
discreetly low, revealed a neck white and firmly moulded as that of the
Venus of Milo.  Around her throat, suspended by a golden chain so fine
as to be almost imperceptible, was a single diamond set in a thin ring
of gold, a large stone of magnificent lustre.  It was her only ornament,
but, flashing and glittering with a thousand fires, it was quite
sufficient.  She wore no rings.  Her hands, white and well-formed, were
devoid of any jewels.  The single diamond gleamed and glittered as it
rose and fell upon her breast, an ornament assuredly fit to adorn a
princess.

Mrs Anson sat opposite me, chatting pleasantly during the meal, and now
and then her daughter would turn, raise her fine eyes to mine for an
instant, and join in our conversation.  That she was exceedingly clever
and well-informed I at once detected by her terse and smart criticism of
the latest play, which we discussed.  She compared it, with a display of
knowledge that surprised me, to a French play but little known save to
students of the French drama, and once or twice her remarks upon stage
technicalities caused me to suspect that she was an actress.

Mrs Anson, however, dispelled this notion by expressing her disapproval
of the stage as a profession for women, an opinion with which her
daughter at once agreed.  No, she could not be an actress, I felt
assured.  Both mother and daughter bore the unmistakable hallmark of
gentlewomen.

I sat beside Mabel Anson in rapt admiration.  Never before in all my
life had my eyes fallen upon so perfect an incarnation of feminine grace
and marvellous beauty; never before until that moment had a woman's face
held me in such enchantment.

Presently the conversation turned, as it so often does at dinner-tables,
upon certain engagements recently announced, whereupon the Colonel, in
the merry, careless manner habitual to him, advanced the theory that
most girls married with a view to improve their social position.

"As to a husband's fortune," remarked his wife, with that stiff
formality which was her peculiar characteristic, "it really isn't so
important to a woman as the qualities which lead to fortune--ambition,
determination, industry, thrift--and position such a man may attain for
himself."

"And in education?" inquired Miss Anson, softly, apparently interested
in the argument.

"In education a man certainly should be his wife's equal," answered Mrs
Channing.

"And is not good temper essential with a husband?--come, now.  Let's
hear your ideas on that point," said the Colonel, chaffingly, from
behind the big epergne.

Mabel Anson hesitated.  For an instant her lustrous eyes met mine, and
she at once lowered them with a downward sweep of her long dark lashes.

"I don't argue that a girl thinking seriously of her future husband
should lay any great stress on good temper," she answered, in a sweet
musical voice.  "A soldierly form, a pair of good eyes, a noble
profile--any of these might easily outweigh good temper."

"Ah! there, I fear, I disagree with you," I remarked smilingly.  "It has
always appeared to me that after the first year or so married people
rarely think of each other's features, because they are always in each
other's presence.  They become heedless of whether each other's features
are classical or ugly; but they never fail to be cognisant of one
another's temper or shortcomings."

"You speak as though from experience," she laughed, without, however,
attempting to combat my argument.

Another outburst of laughter greeted this bantering remark of hers.

"No," observed Nellie, on my other hand.  "Mr Heaton is the most
confirmed bachelor I know.  I believe he's a woman-hater--if the truth
were told."

"Oh, really, Miss Channing!"  I protested.  "That's certainly too bad of
you.  I assure you I'm no hater of the sex, but an admirer."

"Heaton's about to make a pretty speech," observed the jovial, red-faced
Colonel.  "Go on, Wilford, my dear fellow, we're all attention."

"No," I said, laughing.  "I've been drawn quite unfairly into this
controversy.  Therefore I'll preserve a masterly silence."

"Mr Heaton is, I think, diplomatic," laughed the dark, handsome girl
next to me.  "He has cleared his character of the aspersion cast upon
it, and preserves a dignified attitude."  And she turned and smiled
gaily upon me in triumph.

She was exquisitely charming.  I sat at her side gossiping merrily,
while to my dazzled gaze she presented a beautiful picture of youthful
airy delicacy--feminine sweetness combined with patrician grace.  For
the first time in all my life that petticoated paradox, woman, conveyed
to me the impression of perfect beauty, of timidity and grace, combined
with a natural, inborn dignity.  There was nothing forced or unnatural
in her manner as with other women I had met; none of that affected
mannishness of deportment and slangy embellishments of conversation
which are so characteristic of girls of to-day, be they daughters of
tradesmen or of peers.

She gave me the impression--why, I cannot tell--of one who had passed
under the ennobling discipline of suffering and self-denial.  A
melancholy charm tempered the natural vigour of her mind; her spirit
seemed to stand upon an eminence and look down upon me as one inferior
to her in intellect, in moral principle--in fact, in everything.  From
the very first moment when I had bowed to her on our introduction she
held me spell-bound in fascination.

When the ladies had left, and I sat alone with the Colonel, smoking over
a liqueur, I inquired about her.

"Mrs Anson is the widow of old General Anson," he said.  "He died about
twelve years ago, and they've since lived a great deal abroad."

"Well off?"  I inquired, with affected carelessness.

"Very comfortably, I should say.  Mrs Anson has a fortune of her own, I
believe.  They have a house at present in The Boltons."

"Mabel is extremely good-looking," I remarked.

"Of course, my dear boy," laughed the Colonel, with his liqueur-glass
poised in his hand, a twinkle in his eye.  "Between us, she's the
prettiest girl in London.  She creates a sensation wherever she goes,
for beauty like hers isn't met with twice in a lifetime.  Lucky chap,
whoever marries her."

"Yes," I said reflectively, and then diligently pursued the topic in an
endeavour to learn further details regarding her.  My host either knew
very little, or purposely affected ignorance--which, I was unable to
determine.  He had known her father intimately, having been in his
regiment long ago.  That was about all I learnt further.

So we tossed away our cigars, drained our glasses, and rejoined the four
ladies who were awaiting us in the drawing-room, where later, at Mrs
Channing's urgent persuasion, my divinity in blue seated herself at the
piano, and in a sweet, clear contralto sang in Italian a charming solo
from Puccini's _Boheme_, the notable opera of that season.

Then, with the single diamond glittering at her throat, she came back to
where I stood, and sinking into the cosy-corner with its pretty hangings
of yellow silk, she accepted my congratulations with a delicate grace, a
charming dignity, and a grateful smile.

At last, however, the hour of parting came, and reluctantly--very
reluctantly--I took her small hand, bent over it, and handed her into
her carriage beside her mother.

"Good-night," she cried merrily, and next instant the fine pair of bays
plunged away into the rainy night.

I returned into the hall, and my host helped me into my overcoat.

We were alone, for I had made my adieux to his wife and daughters.

"Wilford," he said very gravely, as he gripped my hand prior to my
departure, "we are old friends.  Will you permit me to say one word
without taking offence at it?"

"Certainly," I answered, surprised.  "What is it?"

"I've noticed to-night that, like many another man, you are entranced by
the beauty of Mabel Anson.  Be careful not to make a fool of yourself."

"I don't understand," I said quickly.

"Well, all I would say is, that if you desire happiness and peace of
mind, steel your heart against her," he answered with a distinct air of
mystery.

"You speak in enigmas."

"I merely give you a timely warning, that's all, my dear fellow.  Now,
don't be offended, but go home and think it over, and resolve never
again to see her--never, you understand--never."





THE FOURTEENTH OF OCTOBER.

Long and deeply I pondered over the Colonel's words.  That he had some
underlying motive in thus warning me against the woman by whom I had
become so fascinated was vividly apparent, yet to all my demands he
remained dumb.  On the afternoon following I found him in the St
James's Club--that club of diplomatists--and reverted to the subject.
But all the response he vouchsafed was--

"I've merely warned you, my dear fellow.  I shall say no more.  I, of
course, don't blame you for admiring her, I only tell you to pull
yourself up short."

"But why?"

"Because if you go further than admiration you'll be treading dangerous
ground--devilish dangerous, I can assure you."

"You mean that she has a jealous lover?"  I suggested.

"She has no lover, as far as I'm aware," he answered.

"Then, speaking candidly, Channing," I said, "I don't see why you should
turn prophet like this without giving me any reason."

"My reason is briefly told," he said with unusual gravity.  "I don't
wish to see you upset and unhappy, now that you've recovered your
sight."

His words seemed very lame ones.

"Why should I be unhappy?"

"Because Mabel Anson can never be more to you than an acquaintance; she
can never reciprocate your love.  I tell you plainly that if you allow
yourself to become entranced and all that sort of thing, you'll only
make a confounded ass of yourself."

"You certainly speak very plainly," I observed, annoyed that he should
interfere so prematurely in a matter which was assuredly my affair
alone.

"I speak because I have your welfare at heart, Wilford," he answered in
a kindly tone.  "I only regret now that I asked you to my table to meet
her.  It is my fault--entirely my fault."

"You talk as though she were some genius of evil," I laughed.  "Let me
act as I think fit, my dear Channing."

"Let you go headlong to the devil, eh?" he snapped.

"But to love her is not to go on the downward path, surely?"  I cried
incredulously.

"I warn you, once and for all, to have nothing whatever to do with her,"
he said.  "I know her--you do not."

But I laughed him to scorn.  His words seemed utterly absurd, as though
his mind were filled by some strong prejudice which he dared not to
utter for fear of laying himself open to an action for slander.  If her
acquaintance were so extremely undesirable, why did he invite her and
her mother to his table?  His words were not borne out by his own
actions.

So I bade him farewell rather coolly, and left the club abruptly, in
anger with myself at having sought him, or bestowed a single thought
upon his extraordinary warning.

In the days that followed my mind was fully engrossed by recollections
of her charm and beauty.  Like every other man, I had had, before my
blindness, one or two minor affairs of the heart, but never before had I
experienced the grand passion.  I had, indeed, admired several other
women of various ages and various stations, but none had ever approached
in grace, beauty, or refinement the woman who had so suddenly come into
my life, and so quickly gone out of it.

Yes, I openly confess that I, who had of later years determined to
remain a bachelor, was deeply in love with her.  Indeed, for the time, I
actually forgot the grim shadow of evil which had in my blindness fallen
upon me.

Hither and thither in the great world of London I went with my eyes ever
open in eagerness to catch a glimpse of her.  I lounged in the Row at
the fashionable hour; went to the opera, and swept boxes and stalls with
my glasses; and strolled about Regent Street, Oxford Street, and High
Street, Kensington, in the vicinity of those great drapery emporiums so
dear alike to the feminine heart and to the male pocket.  For ten days
or so I spent greater part of my time in searching for her slim, erect
figure among the bustling London crowds.  I knew her address, it was
true, but my acquaintance was not sufficient to warrant a call,
therefore I was compelled to seek a chance encounter.

All, however, was in vain.  I had firmly resolved to take no heed of the
Colonel's extraordinary premonition, and laughed at his dehortatory
suggestions; for I meant at all costs to meet her again.  One day I
suddenly recollected that in conversation Mrs Anson had mentioned that
her daughter was a student at the Royal Academy of Music.  If so, then
she would undoubtedly go there alone on certain days to take her
lessons.  By carefully watching I might, I thought, meet her as if by
accident.  So I at once set to work to make inquiries, and discovered
through tipping one of the hall-porters of the institution that Miss
Anson came there every Tuesday and Friday at two o'clock in the
afternoon.  The next day chanced to be Tuesday, therefore I went to
Hanover Square and waited for her at the corner of Tenterden Street.  As
I watched I saw quite a number of smart-looking lady students pass into
the institution, but, although I remained on the alert for nearly two
hours, she did not come, and at length I was compelled to return home
wearied, unsuccessful, and dispirited.

That night, however, a blow fell upon me.  An incident which I had
constantly dreaded occurred, for by the last post was delivered one of
those strange typewritten mandates from the unknown.  The envelope was a
blue-grey one, such as lawyers use, and the postmark showed that it had
been dispatched from the Lombard Street office, in the City.  I tore it
open in fear and trepidation, and glanced at the few even lines it
contained.  The lines I read were signed by the word "Avel," traced with
a heavy hand in rough Roman capitals, and were as follows:--

"To-morrow, the fourteenth of October, enter the Park at Grosvenor Gate
at four o'clock, and wait at the third seat on the path which leads to
the band-stand."

I stood silent, with the mysterious missive in my hand.  Some secret
service was evidently required of me.  The shadow of that fateful night
had again fallen, crushing me beneath its weight of mystery and crime.
I thought of the unknown Edna, and pictured her in comparison with
Mabel.  In my helplessness I had become an unwilling tool in the hands
of the former, and now I hated and despised her.  This galling servitude
which she had imposed upon me under penalty of death was doubly irksome
now that I loved; yet so mysterious and tragic were all the
circumstances that I feared to break the bond that I had given.

In ordinary circumstances I think I should have been eager to obey this
sudden demand to go to the Park on the following day.  There was a
distinct air of adventure in the appointment, and, eager to fathom the
mystery surrounding Edna, I saw that this meeting might furnish me with
some clue.  But I recollected Mabel, all sweetness and purity, and hated
it all.  Edna had declared that she herself was not the mysterious
"Avel," yet I had no reason to disbelieve her statement.  To me it
seemed as though she were acting under instructions which had for their
object the preservation of the secret of the midnight crime.

Who was the young man who had fallen victim?  His identity puzzled me
always, until the problem had become so perplexing as to drive me to
despair.  Although time after time I had searched the newspapers, I had
found no one answering to his description mentioned as missing.  He had
evidently been done to death and his body disposed of without a single
inquiry, while the crime had been concealed with an ingenuity which
appalled me.  Might I, myself, not fall victim in a similar manner if I
refused to obey these strange mandates of an unknown hand?

These thoughts were the reverse of reassuring, for even if I went to the
police they would be unable to assist me.  A detective might keep the
appointment in the Park, but it was certain on seeing a stranger in the
vicinity the person who intended to meet me would give him a very wide
berth.

That hot night I lay awake through many hours calmly reviewing the whole
situation.  On the last occasion when I had obeyed the order of my
mysterious correspondent--sent undoubtedly at Edna's instigation--I had
profited considerably.  Was the present order for good or for evil?

Naturally, I had always been fond of adventure, for I came of a family
of sailors.  But the gruesome incidents of that single night when I had
wandered alone in London had utterly unnerved me.  I had become so
surrounded by mystery that each effort of mine to elucidate it caused me
to sink deeper and deeper into the complex quagmire of uncertainty.

Perhaps Edna herself desired to speak with me, now that I could see.
This suggestion took possession of me, and next morning I was anxious
and interested in the appointment.  Soon after three I took an omnibus
from the Strand to the corner of Park Lane, and on the stroke of four
entered the Park at Grosvenor Gate and glanced eagerly around.  No one
was in the vicinity save one or two loungers of the "unemployed" type
and two or three nursemaids with children.  Without difficulty I soon
found the seat indicated, and sat down to wait.  It was a pleasant spot
beneath a large chestnut tree, quiet and more secluded than any of the
others.  Evidently my correspondent knew the Park well.

I lit a cigarette and possessed myself in patience.  After some five
minutes or so a female figure entered the gate and approached in my
direction.  It was that of an elderly woman of rather common type, and
as she came straight towards me I waited her with some curiosity, but
she passed me by without a look, and continued on her way.  Then I knew
that she was not the person who intended to meet me, and laughed within
myself.

My position was one of curiosity, sitting there prepared to meet some
person unknown.  We have all of us, at one time or another, sat awaiting
persons we have never before seen, and we have invariably found mental
pictures of their appearance utterly different from their real aspect.
It was so with me at that moment.  I sat waiting and wondering for half
an hour or so, watching narrowly all who chanced to approach, until I
began to suspect that for some reason or other the appointment would not
be kept.

A glance at my watch showed it to be already twenty minutes to five.  My
patience was exhausted, and I felt annoyed that I should be thus brought
here on a purposeless errand.  Of one man who had passed, a dark-faced,
ill-dressed lounger, I had had my suspicions.  He had idled past,
feigning to take no notice of my presence, yet I saw that he was
covertly watching me.  Perhaps he had been sent to see whether I had
come there alone.  I waited and waited, but in vain.

The shadows had lengthened, the sun was sinking behind the trees in
Kensington Gardens, and at length I cast away the end of my last
remaining cigarette and rose to depart.  Perhaps some untoward incident
had occurred, and I should receive a further communication from my
unknown correspondent.  I had, at least, carried out my part of the
compact, and was therefore free.  So I took my stick and set forth
towards Grosvenor Gate at a brisk pace, for I was tired of waiting, and
my limbs were cramped by my long and fruitless vigil.

I had almost reached the gate leading out to Park Lane when of a sudden,
at a sharp bend of the path, a dark figure loomed up before me.

In an instant I drew up speechless, aghast, amazed.  The mystery was
absolutely dumbfounding.





"IT IS HIS!"

The figure before me was that of a woman, calm, sweet-faced, her
countenance rendered piquant by its expression of surprise.

It was none other than Mabel Anson.

Dressed in a tight-fitting tailor-made gown of some dark cloth, and a
neat toque, she looked dignified and altogether charming.  The slight
severity of attire became her well, for it showed her marvellous figure
to perfection, while the dash of red in her hat gave the necessary touch
of colour to complete a tasteful effect.  Her countenance was concealed
by the thinnest of gauze veils, and as she held forth her well-gloved
hand with an expression of pleasure at the unexpected meeting, her
bangles jingled musically.

"This is indeed a most pleasant surprise, Miss Anson," I said, when I
recovered speech, for so sudden had been our encounter that in the
moment of my astonishment my tongue refused to utter a sound.

"And to me also," she laughed.

"I've been wondering and wondering when we should meet again," I blurted
forth.  "I'm so very glad to see you."

For the first few moments after she had allowed her tiny hand to rest
for an instant in mine we exchanged conventionalities, and then
suddenly, noting a roll of music in her hand, I asked--

"Are you going home?"

"Yes, across the Park," she laughed.  "Mother forbids it, but I much
prefer the Park to those stuffy omnibuses."

"And you've been to your music, I suppose?"  I inquired.

"Yes.  I've not been well for the past few days, and have missed several
lessons.  Now, like a good pupil, I'm endeavouring to make them up, you
know."  And she laughed merrily.

"How many times a week do you go to the Academy?"  I asked, surprised
that she should have gone there that day, after what the hall-porter had
told me.

"Twice, as a general rule," she remarked; "but just now I'm rather
irregular."

"And so you prefer to cross the Park rather than ride by omnibus?"

"Certainly.  Mother doesn't approve of girls riding on the tops of
'buses, and says it's fast.  Therefore I'd much rather walk, for at this
hour half London seems to be going from Piccadilly Circus to
Hammersmith.  I go right across, past the Serpentine, through Kensington
Gardens to the Broad Walk, and out by the small gate next the _Palace
Hotel_," she added, with a sweep of her gloved hand.

Her eyes were lovely.  As she stood there in the fading sunlight she
seemed the fairest vision I had ever seen.  I stood spell-bound by her
marvellous beauty.

"And may I not act as your escort on your walk to-day?"  I asked.

"Certainly.  I have no objection," she answered with graceful dignity,
therefore I turned and walked beside her, carrying her music.

We took the road, which leads straight away to the Magazine, and crosses
the Serpentine beyond.  There in the yellow glow of the October sunset I
lounged at her side and drank my fill of her loveliness.  Surely, I
thought, there could be no more beautiful woman in all the world.  The
Colonel's strange warning recurred to me, but I laughed it to scorn.

As we passed beneath the rustling trees the sun's last rays lit up her
beautiful face with a light that seemed ethereal and tipped her hair
until there seemed a golden halo about her.  I was no lovesick youth, be
it remembered, but a man who had had a bitter experience of the world
and its suffering.  Yet at that hour I was fascinated by the grace of
her superb carriage, the suppleness of her figure, the charm of her
sweet smile, and the soft music of her voice as she chatted to me.

She told me of her love for music; and from the character of the pieces
which formed her studies I knew that she must be a musician of a no mean
order.  The operatic melody which she had sung at the Colonel's was, she
declared, a mere trifle.  We discussed the works of Rossini and Massent,
of Wagner and Mendelssohn, and of Verdi, Puccini, Mascagni, Perosi, and
such latter-day composers.  I had always prided myself that I knew
something of music, but her knowledge was far deeper than mine.

And so we gossiped on, crossing the Park and entering Kensington
Gardens--those beautiful pleasure grounds that always seem so neglected
by the majority of Londoners--while the sun sank and disappeared in its
blood-red afterglow.  She spoke of her life abroad, declaring that she
loved London and was always pleased to return to its wild, turbulent
life.  She had spent some time in Paris, in Vienna, in Berlin, but no
one was half as interesting, she declared, as London.

"But you are not a Londoner, are you?"  I asked.

"No, not exactly," she responded, "although I've lived here such a long
time that I've become almost a Cockney.  Are you a Londoner?"

"No," I answered; "I'm a countryman, born and bred."

"I heard the Colonel remark that other night that you had been afflicted
by blindness for some time.  Is that so?"

I responded in the affirmative.

"Terrible!" she ejaculated, glancing at me with those wonderful dark
eyes of hers that seemed to hold me in fascination and look me through
and through.  "We who possess our eyesight cannot imagine the great
disadvantages under which the blind are placed.  How fortunate that you
are cured!"

"Yes," I explained.  "The cure is little short of a miracle.  The three
greatest oculists in London all agreed that I was incurable, yet there
one day came to me a man who said he could give me back my sight.  I
allowed him to experiment, and he was successful.  From the day that I
could see plainly he, curiously enough, disappeared."

"How strange!  Did he never come and see you afterwards?"

"No.  He took no reward, but simply discontinued his visits.  I do not
even know his real name."

"How extraordinary!" she observed, greatly interested.  "I really
believe that there is often more romance and mystery in real life than
in books.  Such a circumstance appears absolutely bewildering."

"If to you, Miss Anson, then how much more to me!  I, who had
relinquished all hope of again looking upon the world and enjoying life,
now find myself actually in possession of my vision and able to mix with
my fellow-men.  Place yourself for a moment in my position, and try to
imagine my constant thankfulness."

"You must feel that a new life is opened to you--that you have begun a
fresh existence," she observed with a true touch of sympathy in her
sweet voice.  Then she added, as if by afterthought.  "How many of us
would be glad to commence life afresh!"

The tone in which she uttered that sentence seemed incongruous.  A few
moments before she had been all brightness and gaiety, but in those
words there vibrated a distinctly gloomy note.

"Surely you do not desire to commence your life again?"  I said.

She sighed slightly.

"All of us have our burden of regrets," she answered vaguely, raising
her eyes for an instant to mine, and then lowering them.

We appeared in those moments to grow confidential.  The crimson and
orange was fast fading from the sky.  It was growing dark beneath the
shadow of the great elms, and already the line of street lamps out in
Kensington Gore were twinkling through the foliage on our left.  No one
was in the vicinity, and we were walking very slowly, for, truth to
tell, I desired to delay our parting until the very last moment.  Of all
the leafy spots in giant London, there is none so rural, so romantic, or
so picturesque in summer as that portion of Kensington Gardens lying
between Queen's Gate and the Broad Walk.  Save for the dull roar of
distant traffic, one might easily fancy one's self far in the country, a
hundred miles from the sound of Bow Bells.

"But you are young, Miss Anson," I observed philosophically, after a
brief pause.  "And if I may be permitted to say so, you have scarcely
begun to live your life.  Yet you actually wish to commence afresh!"

"Yes," she responded briefly, "I do.  Strange, is it not?"

"Is the past, then, so full of bitterness?"  I asked, the Colonel's
strange warning recurring to me at the same moment.

"Its bitterness is combined with regrets," she answered huskily, in a
low voice.

"But you, young, bright, happy, and talented, who need not think of the
trials of everyday life, should surely have no regrets so deep as to
cause you this anxiety and despair," I said, with a feeling of
tenderness.  "I am ten years older than you, therefore I may be
permitted to speak like this, even though my words may sound
presumptuous."

"Continue," she exclaimed.  "I assure you that in my present position I
appreciate any words of sympathy."

"You have my deepest sympathy, Miss Anson; of that I assure you," I
declared, detecting in her words a desire to confide in me.  "If at your
age you already desire to recommence life, your past cannot have been a
happy one."

"It has been far from happy," she answered in a strange, mechanical
voice.  "Sometimes I think that I am the unhappiest woman in all the
world."

"No, no," I hastened to reassure her.  "We all, when in trouble, imagine
that our burden is greater than that of any of our fellows, and that
while others escape, upon us alone fall the graver misfortunes."

"I know, I know," she said.  "But a pleasant face and an air of
carelessness ofttimes conceal the most sorrowful heart.  It is so in my
case."

"And your sorrow causes you regret, and makes you wish to end your
present life and commence afresh," I said gravely.  "To myself, ignorant
of the circuit stances, it would seem as though you repented of some act
or other."

"What do you mean?" she gasped quickly, looking at me with a strange
expression in her dark eyes.  "I do not repent--I repent nothing!"

I saw that I had made a grave mistake.  In my fond and short-sighted
enthusiasm I had allowed myself to speak a little too confidentially,
whereupon her natural dignity had instantly rebelled.  At once I
apologised, and in an instant she became appeased.

"I regret extremely that you should have such a weight of anxiety upon
your heart," I said.  "If I can do anything to assist you, rely upon
me."

"You are extremely kind," she answered in a gloomy tone; "but there is
nothing--absolutely nothing."

"I really can't understand the reason why, with every happiness around
you, you should find yourself thus plunged in this despair," I remarked,
puzzled.  "Your home life is, I presume, happy enough?"

"Perfectly.  I am entirely my own mistress, save in those things which
might break through the ordinary conventionalities of life.  I must
admit to you that I am rather unconventional sometimes."

I had wondered whether, like so many other girls, she had some imaginary
grievance in her home; but now, finding that this was not so, it
naturally occurred to me that the cause of her strange desire to live
her life over again arose through the action of some faithless lover.
How many hundreds of girls with wealth and beauty, perfectly happy in
all else, are daily wearing out their lives because of the fickleness of
the men to whom they have foolishly given their hearts!  The
tightly-laced corsets of every eight girls in ten conceals a heart
filled by the regrets of a love long past; the men smile airily through
the wreaths of their tobacco-smoke, while the women, in those little
fits of melancholy which they love to indulge in, sit and reflect in
silence upon the might-have-beens.  Is there, I wonder, a single one of
us, man or woman, who does not remember our first love, the deep
immensity of that pair of eyes; the kindly sympathy of that face, which
in our immature years we thought our ideal, and thereupon bowed the knee
in worship?  If such there be, then they are mere unrefined boors
without a spark of romance in their nature, or poetry within their soul.
Indeed, the regrets arising from a long-forgotten love ofttimes mingle
pleasure with sadness, and through one's whole life form cherished
memories of those flushed days of a buoyant youth.  To how many of those
who read these lines will be recalled vivid recollections of a summer
idyll of long ago; a day when, with the dainty or manly object of their
affections, they wandered beside the blue sea, or on the banks of the
tranquil, willow-lined river, or perhaps hand-in-hand strolled beneath
the great old forest trees, where the sunlight glinted and touched the
gnarled trunks with grey and gold!  To each will come back the sweet
recollection of a sunset hour now long, long ago, when they pressed the
lips of the one they loved, and thought the rough world as rosy as that
summer afterglow.  The regret of those days always remains--often only a
pleasant memory, but, alas! sometimes a lamentation bordering upon
despair, until the end of our days.

"And may I not know something, however little, of the cause of this
oppression upon you?"  I asked of her, after we had walked some distance
in silence.  "You tell me that you desire to wipe out the past and
commence afresh.  The reason of this interests me," I added.

"I don't know why you should interest yourself in me," she murmured.
"It is really unnecessary."

"No, no," I exclaimed hastily.  "Although our acquaintance has been of
but brief duration, I am bold enough to believe that you count me among
your friends.  Is it not so?"

"Certainly, or I would not have given you permission to walk with me
here," she answered with a sweetness which showed her unostentatious
delicacy of character.

"Then, as your friend, I beg of you to repose whatever confidence in me
you may think fit, and to be assured that I will never abuse it."

"Confidences are unnecessary between us," she responded.  "I have to
bear my grief alone."

"Your words sound strange, coming from one whom I had thought so merry
and light-hearted," I said.

"Are you, then, ignorant of the faculty a woman has of concealing her
sorrows behind an outward show of gaiety--that a woman always possesses
two countenances, the face and the mask?"

"You are scarcely complimentary to your own sex," I answered with a
smile.  "Yet that is surely no reason why you should be thus wretched
and downhearted."  Her manner puzzled me, for since the commencement of
our conversation she had grown strangely melancholy--entirely unlike her
own bright self.  I tried to obtain from her some clue to the cause of
her sadness, but in vain.  My short acquaintance with her did not
warrant me pressing upon her a subject which was palpably distasteful;
nevertheless, it seemed to me more than strange that she should thus
acknowledge to me her sorrow at a moment when any other woman would have
practised coquetry.

"I can only suffer in silence," she responded when I asked her to tell
me something of the cause of her unhappiness.

"Excuse my depression this evening.  I know that to you I must seem a
hypochondriac, but I will promise you to wear the mask--if ever we meet
again."

"Why do you speak so vaguely?"  I inquired in quick apprehension.  "I
certainly hope that we shall meet again, many, many times.  Your words
would make it appear as though such meeting is improbable."

"I think it is," she answered simply.  "You are very kind to have borne
with me like this," she added, her manner quickly changing; "and if we
do meet, I'll try not to have another fit of melancholy."

"Yes, Miss Anson," I said, halting in the path, "let us meet again.
Remember that we have to-day commenced a friendship--a friendship which
I trust will last always."

But she slowly shook her head, as though the heavy sadness of her heart
still possessed her.

"Friendship may exist between us, but frequent meetings are, I fear,
impossible."

"Why?  You told me only a moment ago that you were your own mistress," I
observed.

"And so I am in most things," she answered.  "But as far as meeting you,
we can only leave that to chance."

"Why?"

"Please do not endeavour to force me to explanations," she answered with
firmness.  "I merely tell you that frequent meetings with you are
unlikely--that is all."

We had walked on, and were nearing the gate leading out into the High
Street, Kensington.

"In other words, then, you are not altogether pleased with my
companionship?"

"No, really," she laughed sweetly.  "I didn't say that.  You have no
reason to jump at such a conclusion.  I thank you very much indeed for
your words of sympathy."

"And you have no desire to see me again?"  I interrupted, in a tone of
bitter disappointment.

"If such were the case, ours would be a very extraordinary friendship,
wouldn't it?" and she lifted her eyes to mine with a kindly look.

"Then I am to take it that my companionship on this walk has not been
distasteful to you?"  I asked anxiously.

She inclined her head with dignified air, saying.  "Certainly.  I feel
that this evening I have at least found a friend--a pleasant thought
when one is comparatively friendless."

"And as your friend--your devoted friend--I ask to be permitted to see
you sometimes," I said earnestly, for, lingering at her side, I was very
loth to part from her.  "If I can ever be of any assistance, command
me."

"You are very kind," she answered, with a slight tremor in her voice.
"I shall remember your words always."  Then, putting forth her
well-gloved hand, as we stood upon the kerb of the High Street, she
added, "It is getting late.  We've taken such a long time across the
Park that I must drive home;" and she made a gesture to a passing
hansom.

"Before we part," I said, "I will give you a card, so that should you
require any service of me you will know where to write;" and, as we
stood beneath the street lamp, I drew out a card and, with a pencil I
took from my vest-pocket, scribbled my address.

In silence she watched, but just as I had finished she suddenly gripped
my hand, uttering a loud cry of amazement.

"What's that you have there?" she demanded.  "Let me see it!"

Next instant--before, indeed, I could be aware of her intention--she had
snatched the pencil from my grasp, and was examining it closely beneath
the gaslight.

"Ah!" she gasped, glaring at me in alarm.  "It is--yes, it is his!"

The small gold pencil which I had inadvertently used was the one I had
taken from the pocket of the dead unknown on that fateful August night.





THE ENCHANTMENT OF A FACE.

The face of Mabel Anson, my new-found friend and idyll, had in that
instant changed.  Her countenance was pale as death, while the hand
holding the small pencil trembled.

"Whence did you obtain this?" she demanded in an awe-stricken tone,
which showed plainly that she recognised it.  She held her breath in
expectancy.

What could I reply?  To explain the truth was impossible, for I had
pledged my honour to Edna to preserve the secret.  Besides, I had no
wish to horrify her by the strange story of my midnight adventure.
Hence a lie arose involuntarily to my lips.

"I found it," I stammered.

"Found it?  Where?"

"I found it when groping about during the time I was blind, and I've
carried it ever since, wondering whether one day I should discover its
owner."

"It is extraordinary?" she gasped--"most extraordinary."

"You appear to recognise it," I observed, much puzzled at her attitude.
"If you can tell me to whom it belongs I will return it."

She hesitated, and with a quick effort regained her self-control.

"I mean it possesses an extraordinary resemblance to one I have seen
many times before--but I suppose there are lots of pencil-cases of the
same shape," she added with affected carelessness.

"But there is a curious, unintelligible cypher engraved upon it," I
said.  "Did you notice it?"

"Yes.  It is the engraving which makes me doubt that I know its owner.
His initials were not those."

"You speak in the past tense," I observed.  "Why!"

"Because--well, because we are no longer friends--if you desire to know
the truth;" and she handed me back the object, which, with the
dress-stud, formed the only clue I had to the identity of the
unfortunate victim of the assassin.

There was something in her manner which was to me the reverse of
convincing.  I felt absolutely certain that this unimportant object had,
in reality, been identified by her, and that with some hidden motive she
was now intentionally misleading me.

"Then you do not believe that this really belonged to your friend?"  I
asked, holding it up to her gaze.

"No," she answered quickly, averting her face as though the sight of it
were obnoxious.  "I feel certain that it did not.  Its resemblance is
striking--that's all."

"It would have been a remarkable coincidence if it really were the
property of your friend," I said.

"Very remarkable," she admitted, still regarding me strangely.  "Yet the
trite saying that `The world is small' is nevertheless very true.  When
I first saw it I felt certain it belonged to a gentleman I knew, but on
closer examination I find it is older, more battered, and bears initials
which have evidently been engraved several years."

"Where did your friend lose his?"  I inquired, reflecting upon the
lameness of her story.  The mere recognition of a lost pencil-case would
never have affected her in the manner that sight of this one had if
there were not some deeper meaning attached to it.

"I have no idea.  Indeed, I am not at all sure that it is not still in
his possession."

"And how came you to be so well acquainted with its aspect?"  I asked,
in eagerness to ascertain the truth.

She hesitated for a few moments.  "Because," she faltered--"because it
was a present from me."

"To an admirer?"

She did not answer, but even in that dim lamplight I detected the
tell-tale flush mounting to her cheeks.

Then, in order, apparently, to cover her confusion, she added--

"I must really go.  I shall be late for dinner, and my mother hates to
wait for me.  Good-bye."

Our hands clasped, our eyes met, and I saw in hers a look of deep
mystery, as though she held me in suspicion.  Her manner and her
identification of that object extracted from the pocket of the dead man
were very puzzling.

"Good-bye," I said.  "I hope soon to have the pleasure of meeting you
again.  I have enjoyed this walk of ours immensely."

"When we meet--if ever we do," she answered with a mischievous smile,
"remember that I have promised to wear the mask.  Good-bye."  And she
twisted her skirts gracefully, entered the cab, and a moment later was
driven off, leaving me alone on the kerb.

I hesitated whether to return home by 'bus or Underground Railway, but,
deciding on the latter, continued along the High Street to the station,
and journeyed to the Temple by that sulphurous region of dirt and
darkness known as the "Inner Circle."

The reader may readily imagine how filled with conflicting thoughts was
my mind on that homeward journey.  Although I adored Mabel Anson with a
love beyond all bounds, and would on that evening have declared my
passion for her had I dared, yet I could not disguise from myself that
sight of the pencil-case I had taken from the dead unknown had wrought
an instant and extraordinary change in her.

She had identified it.  Of that fact there was no doubt.  Her lame
explanation that it bore a resemblance to the one she had given to her
friend was too palpably an afterthought.  I was vexed that she should
have thus attempted a deception.  It was certainly true that one gold
pencil-case is very like another, and that a Birmingham maker may turn
out a thousand of similar pattern, yet the intricate cypher engraved on
the one in question was sufficient by which to identify it.  It was
these very initials which had caused her to deny that it was really the
one she had purchased and presented; yet I felt convinced that what she
had told me was untrue, and that those very initials had been placed
upon it by her order.

Again, had she not spoken of its owner in the past tense?  This, in
itself, was a very suspicious circumstance, and led me to the belief
that she was aware of his death.  If he were dead, then certainly he
would no longer be her friend.

Her sudden and abject amazement at seeing the pencil in my hand; her
exclamation of surprise; her eagerness to examine it; all were facts
which showed plainly that she knew that it remained no longer in his
possession, and was yet dumbfounded to find it in my hand.  Had she not
also regarded me with evident suspicion?  Perhaps, having identified her
present, she suspected me of foul play?

The thought held me petrified.  For aught I knew she might be well aware
of that man's tragic end, and the discovery of part of his property in
my possession was to her evidence that I had committed murder.

My position was certainly growing serious.  I detected in the rather
formal manner in which she took leave of me a disinclination to shake my
hand.  Perhaps she believed it to be the hand of the murderer.  Indeed,
my declaration that I had found that incriminating object was in itself
sufficient to strengthen her suspicion if, as seemed quite probable, she
was aware of her friend's tragic end.  Yet I had really found it.  It
was no lie.  I had found it in his pocket, and taken it as a clue by
which afterwards to identify him.

Now, if it were true that the man who had been struck dead at my side
was actually Mabel's friend, then I was within measurable distance of
elucidating the mystery of that fateful night and ascertaining the
identity of the mysterious Edna, and also of that ruler of my destiny,
who corresponded with me under the pseudonym of "Avel."

This thought caused me to revert to that hour when I had sat upon the
seat in the Park, keeping a tryst with some person unknown.  Seated in
the corner of the railway-carriage I calmly reflected.  More than a
coincidence it seemed that at the moment my patience became exhausted,
and I rose to leave the spot my mysterious correspondent had appointed
for the meeting, I should have come face to face with the woman whose
grace and beauty held me beneath their spell.  For some purpose--what I
knew not--I had been sent to that particular seat to wait.  I had
remained there in vain, smoking a dozen cigarettes, reading through my
paper even to the advertisements, or impatiently watching every person
who approached, yet the moment I rose I encountered the very person for
whom I had for days past been in active search.

Had Mabel's presence there any connexion with the mysterious order which
I had obeyed?  Upon this point I was filled with indecision.  First,
what possible connecting link could there be between her natural
movements and the letter from that unknown hand?  As far as I could
discern there was absolutely none, I tried to form theories, but failed.
I knew that Mabel attended at the Royal Academy of Music, and what was
more natural than that she should cross the Park on her way home?  Her
way did not lie along the path where I had kept such a watchful vigil,
and had I not risen and passed towards Grosvenor Gate at that moment we
should not have met.  There, indeed, seemed no possible combination
between the request I had received from my unknown correspondent and her
presence there.  In my wild imaginings I wondered whether she were
actually the woman whom in my blindness I had known as Edna, but next
instant flouted the idea.

The voice, the touch, the hand, all were different.  Again, her personal
appearance was not at all that of the woman described by West, the
cabman who had driven me home after my strange adventures.

No; she could not be Edna.

As the train roared through the stifling tunnels City-wards, I strove to
arrive at some decision.  Puzzled and perplexed at the various phases
presented by the enigma which ever grew more and more complicated, I
found any decision an extremely difficult matter.  I am not a man given
to forming theories upon insufficient evidence, nor jumping to immature
conclusions, therefore I calmly and carefully considered each fact in
its sequence as related in this narrative.  The absence of motives in
several instances prevented any logical deduction.  Nevertheless, I
could not somehow prevent a suspicion arising within me that the
appointment made by my anonymous correspondent had some remote connexion
with my meeting with the woman who had so suddenly come into my life--a
mere suspicion, it is true, but the fact that no one had appeared to
keep the appointment strengthened it considerably.

Whenever I thought of Mabel, recollections of Channing's strange
admonition arose within me.  Why had he uttered that warning ere I had
been acquainted with her a few hours?  To say the least, it was
extraordinary.  And more especially so as he refused to give any
explanation of his reasons.

The one dark spot in my life, now that I had recovered my sight, was the
ever-present recollection of that midnight tragedy.  Its remembrance
held me appalled when I thought of it.  And when I reflected upon my own
culpability in not giving information to the police, and that in all
probability this neglect of mine had allowed the assassin to escape scot
free, I was beside myself with vexation and regret.  My thoughts for
ever tortured me, being rendered the more bitter by the reflection that
I had placed myself in the power of one who had remained concealed, and
whose identity was inviolable.

As I declared in the opening of the narrative, it seems almost
incredible that in these end-of-the-century-days a man could find
himself in such a plight, surrounded by mysterious enemies, and held in
bondage by one unknown and unrevealed.  Laboriously I tried to unravel
the tangled skein of events and so extricate myself, but, tired with the
overtask, I found that the mystery grew only more inscrutable.

The woman I loved--the woman to whom I had fondly hoped some day ere
long to make the declaration of the secret of my heart--had discovered
in my possession an object which might well be viewed as evidence of a
foul and cowardly crime.  I feared--indeed, I felt assured--that her
sweet sympathy had, in an instant, been turned to hatred.

I loved her.  I adored her with all the strength of my being, and I knew
that without her my life, in the future must only be an aimless blank.
In the sweetest natures there can be no completeness and consistency
without moral energy, and that Mabel possessed it was plainly shown.  In
her confidences with me as we traversed the Park and Kensington Gardens
she had shown, with the most perfect artfulness, that she had that
instinctive unconscious address of her sex which always renders a woman
doubly charming.  Persons who unite great sensibility and lively fancy
possess unconsciously the power of placing themselves in the position of
another and imagining rather than perceiving what is in their hearts.  A
few women possess this faculty, but men never.  It is not inconsistent
with extreme simplicity of character, and quite distinct from that kind
of art which is the result of natural acuteness and habits of
observation--quick to perceive the foibles of others, and as quick to
turn them to its own purpose; which is always conscious of itself, and
if united with strong intellect, seldom perceptible to others.

In her chat with me she had no design formed or conclusion previously
drawn, but her intuitive quickness of feeling, added to her imagination,
caused her to half-confide in me her deep sorrow.  Her compassionate
disposition, her exceeding gentleness, which gave the prevailing tone to
her character, her modesty, her tenderness, her grace, her almost
ethereal refinement and delicacy, all showed a true poetic nature
within, while her dark, fathomless eyes betrayed that energy of passion
which gave her character its concentrated power.

Was it any wonder, even though she might have been betrayed into a
momentary tergiversation, that I bowed down and worshipped her?  She was
my ideal; her personal beauty and the tender sweetness of her character
were alike perfect.  Therefore my love for her was a passion--that
headlong vehemence, that fluttering and hope, fear and transport, that
giddy intoxication of heart and sense which belongs to the novelty of
true love which we feel once, and but once, in our lives.

Yet I was held perplexed and powerless by her unexpected and
unacknowledged identification of that clue to the unknown dead.





A REVELATION.

Although many days passed, no word of apology came from my mysterious
correspondent for not having kept the appointment.  I watched every post
for nearly a fortnight, and as I received no explanation, my suspicion
regarding Mabel's connexion with the strange affair became, of course,
strengthened.

With heart-sinking I had taken leave of her on the kerb in Kensington
High Street on that well-remembered evening, feeling that the likelihood
of our frequent meeting was very remote, especially now that she
apparently held me in suspicion.  In this case, however, I was mistaken,
for within a week we met again quite accidentally in Bond Street, and,
finding her disposed to accept my companionship, I accompanied her
shopping, and spent an extremely pleasant afternoon.  Her mother was
rather unwell, she explained, and that accounted for her being alone.

She was dressed entirely in black, but with a quiet elegance that was
surprising.  I had never known before that day how smart and _chic_ a
woman could appear in a gown of almost funereal aspect.  Her manner
towards me retained nothing of its previous suspicion; she was bright
and merry, without that cloud of unhappiness that had so strangely
overshadowed her on the last occasion we had been together.  She
possessed a clever wit, and gossiped and joked amusingly as we went from
shop to shop, ordering fruit for dessert, and flowers for
table-decoration.  That her mother was wealthy appeared certain from the
extravagant prices which she gave for fruits out of season and choice
hothouse flowers.  She bought the best she could procure, and seemed
utterly regardless of expense.

I remarked how dear were some grapes which she had ordered, but she only
smiled and gave her shoulders a little shrug.

This recklessness was not done to impress me, for I was quick to detect
that the shopkeepers knew her as a good customer, and brought forward
their most expensive wares as a matter of course.

Although at first she declined my invitation, as though she considered
it a breach of the _convenances_, I at length persuaded her to take some
tea with me at Blanchard's, and we continued our gossip as we sat
together at one of the little tables surrounded by other ladies out
shopping with their male encumbrances.

I had, rather unwisely, perhaps, passed a critical remark regarding a
lady who had entered in an unusually striking toilette, in which she
looked very hot and extremely uncomfortable, and laughing at what I had
said, she replied--

"You are certainly right.  We women always overweigh ourselves in our
garments, to say nothing of other and more fatiguing things.  Half of
life's little worries accrue from our clothes.  From tight collar to
tight shoe, and not forgetting a needlessly befeathered hat, we take
unto ourselves burdens that we should be much happier without."

"I agree entirely," I said, smiling at her philosophy.  "Some blatant
crank bent on self-advertisement might do worse than found an
Anti-ornamental Dress League.  Just think how much of life's trials
would at once slip off a man if he wore neither collar nor tie--
especially the dress-tie!"

"And off a woman, if she wore neither belt, gloves, nor neck
arrangement!"

"Exactly.  It would be actually making us a present for life of nearly
an hour a day.  That would be seven hours a week, or nearly a fortnight
a year," I said.  "It's worth consideration."

"Do you remember the derision heaped upon that time-saving arrangement
of our ancestors, the elastic-side boot?" she observed, with a merry
smile.  "But just fancy the trouble they must have saved in lacing and
buttoning!  Sewing on shoe-buttons ought always to be done by criminals
condemned to hard labour.  Button-sewing tries the conscientiousness and
thoroughness of the work more than anything else, and I'm certain
oakum-picking can't be worse.  It also tries the quality of the thread
more than anything else; and as to cottons, well, it treats them as
Samson did the withs."

The carriage met her outside the Stores in the Haymarket at five
o'clock, and before she took leave of me she mischievously asked--

"Well, and how do you find me when I wear my mask?"

"Charming," I responded with enthusiasm.  "Mask or no mask, you are
always the same to me, the most charming friend I have ever had."

"No, no," she laughed.  "It isn't good form to flatter.  Good-bye."

And she stretched forth her small hand, which I pressed warmly, with
deep regret at parting.  A moment later the footman in his brown livery
assisted her into the carriage.  Then she smiled merrily, and bowed as I
raised my hat, and she was borne away westward in the stream of fine
equipages, hers the smartest of them all.

A week later, having seen nothing further of her, I wrote and received a
prompt response.  Then in the happy autumn days that followed we
contrived to meet often, and on each occasion I grew deeper and deeper
in love with her.  Since that evening when we had stood together beneath
the street lamp in Kensington, she had made no mention of the
pencil-case or of its owner.  Indeed, it seemed that her sudden
identification of it had betrayed her into acknowledging that its owner
had been her lover, and that now she was trying to do all she could to
remove any suspicion from my mind.

Nevertheless, the remembrance of that crime and of all the events of
that midnight adventure was ever within my mind, and I had long ago
determined to make its elucidation the chief object of my life.  I had
placed myself beneath the thrall of some person unknown, and meant to
extricate myself and become again a free agent at all costs.

On several occasions I had seen the cabman West on the rank at Hyde Park
Corner, but although he had constantly kept his eyes open in search of
Edna, his efforts had all been in vain.  I had seen also the old
cab-driver who bore the nickname "Doughy," but it turned out that it had
not been his cab which my mysterious protectress had taken after parting
from me.  One point, however, I settled satisfactorily.  On one of our
walks together I contrived that, the man West should see Mabel, but he
afterwards declared that the woman of whom he was in search did not in
the least resemble her.  Therefore, it was certain that Mabel and Edna
were not, as I had once vaguely suspected, one and the same person.

Sometimes I would meet my idol after her studies at the Royal Academy of
Music, and accompany her across the park; at others we would stroll
together in the unfrequented part of Kensington Gardens, or I would walk
with her shopping and carry her parcels, all our meetings being, of
course, clandestine ones.

One morning in the middle of November I was overfed at receiving an
invitation from Mrs Anson to dine at The Boltons, and a couple of days
later the sum of my happiness was rendered complete by finding myself
seated beside Mabel in her own home.

The house possessed an air of magnificence and luxury which I scarcely
expected.  It was furnished with great elegance and taste, while the
servants were of an even more superior character than the house itself.
Among the homes of my many friends in the West End this was certainly
the most luxurious, for money seemed to have been literally squandered
upon its appointments, and yet withal there was nothing whatever garish
nor any trace of a plebeian taste.  There was a combined richness and
quietness about the whole place which impressed one with an air of
severity, while the footman who ushered me in was tall, almost a giant
in stature, and solemn as a funeral mute.

Mrs Anson rose and greeted me pleasantly, while Mabel, in a pretty gown
of coral-pink, also shook my hand and raised her fine dark eyes to mine
with a glance of pleasure and triumph.  It was, no doubt, due to her
that I had been bidden there as guest.  A red-headed, ugly-faced man
named Hickman, and a thin, angular, irritating woman, introduced to me
as Miss Wells, were my only fellow-guests.  The man regarded me with
some suspicion as I entered, and from the first I took a violent dislike
to him.  It may have been his forbidding personal appearance which
caused my distrust.  Now that I reflect, I think it was.  His face was
bloated and deeply furrowed, his eyes large, his lips thick and flabby,
his reddish beard was ill-trimmed and scanty.  He was thick-necked; his
face was further disfigured by a curious dark-blue scar upon the left
jaw, and I could not help remarking within myself, that if some faces
resembled those of animals, his was closely allied to that of a savage
bulldog.  Indeed, I had never before seen such an eminently ugly face as
his.

Yet he spoke with the air and perfect manner of a gentleman.  He bowed
with refined dignity as I was introduced, although I thought his smile
seemed supercilious, while I was almost certain that he exchanged a
curious, contemptuous look with Mabel, who stood behind me.

Was he aware of our little exchanges of confidences?  Had he secretly
watched us in our walks along the leafy byways of Kensington Gardens,
and detected that I loved her?  It seemed very much as though he had,
and that he had endeavoured to disparage me in her eyes.

At Mrs Anson's invitation, I took Mabel in to dinner, and sat next her,
while opposite us sat the dog-faced man with the irritating spinster.
The latter was a fitting companion for him, bony of countenance, her
back straight as a board, her age uncertain, and her voice loud,
high-pitched, and rasping.  She wore a number of bangles on her left
wrist; one of them had pigs and elephants hanging on it, with hearts,
crosses, bells, and framed and glazed shamrock leaves mixed in.  That
would not have mattered much had she not been eating, but as dinner
progressed the room grew a trifle warm, and she unfortunately had a fan
as well as those distressing bangles, which fan she rhythmically waved
to and fro, playing the orchestra softly when fanning herself, or loudly
as she plied her knife and fork "click-clack, jingle-jingle,
tinkle-tinkle, click-clack!" until the eternal music of those pigs,
elephants, crosses, hearts and bells prevented anything beyond a jerky
conversation.  She turned and twisted and toyed with her _menu_,
tinkling and jingling the whole time like a coral consoler or an
infant's rattle.  Little wonder, I thought, that she remained a
spinster.  With such an irritating person to head his household, the
unfortunate husband would be a candidate for Colney Hatch within a
month.  Yet she was evidently a very welcome guest at Mrs Anson's
table, for my hostess addressed her as "dear," and seemed to consider
whatever positive opinion she expressed as entirely beyond dispute.

I liked Mrs Anson.  Although of that extremely frigid type of mother,
very formal and unbending, observing all the rules of society to the
letter, and practically making her life a burden by the
conventionalities, she possessed, nevertheless, a warm-hearted affection
for her child, and seemed constantly solicitous of her welfare.  She
spoke with the very faintest accent with her "r's," and I had, on the
first evening we had met at the colonel's, wondered whether she were of
Scotch, or perhaps foreign, extraction.  The general conversation in the
interval of the Irritating Woman's orchestra turned upon foreign travel,
and incidentally, in answer to an ingenious question I put to her, she
told me that her father had been German, but that she had nearly all her
life lived in England.

The Irritating Woman spoke of going to the Riviera in December,
whereupon Mabel remarked--

"I hope mother will go too.  I'm trying to persuade her.  London is so
dull and miserable in winter compared with Cannes or Nice."

"You know the Riviera well, I suppose?"  I inquired of her.

"Oh, very well," she responded.  "Mother and I have spent four winters
in the south.  There's no place in Europe in winter like the Cote
d'Azur--as the French call it."

"I much prefer the Italian Riviera," chimed Miss Wells's high-pitched
voice.  She made it a point of honour to differ with everybody.  "At
Bordighera, Ospedaletti, San Remo, and Alassio you have much better air,
the same warmth, and at about half the price.  The hotels in Nice and
Cannes are simply ruinous."  Then, turning to Mrs Anson, she added,
"You know, dear, what you said last year."

"We go to the Grand, at Nice, always," answered Mrs Anson.  "It is
dear, certainly, but not exaggeratedly so in comparison with the other
large hotels."

"There seems of late to have been a gradual rise in prices all along the
Riviera," remarked Hickman.  "I've experienced it personally.  Ten or
twelve years ago lived in Nice for the season for about half what it
costs me now."

"That exactly bears out my argument," exclaimed the Irritating Woman, in
triumph.  "The fact is that the French Riviera has become far too dear,
and English people are, fortunately for themselves, beginning to see
that by continuing their journey an extra twenty miles beyond Nice they
can obtain just as good accommodation, live better, breathe purer air,
and not be eternally worried by those gaudy tinsel-shows called
Carnivals, or insane attempts at hilarity miscalled Battles of Flowers."

"Oh, come, Miss Wells," protested Mabel, "surely you won't condemn the
Battles of Flowers at Nice!  Why, they're acknowledged to be amongst the
most picturesque spectacles in the world!"

"I consider, my dear, that they are mere rubbishy ruses on the part of
the Nicois to cause people to buy their flowers and throw them into the
roadway.  It's only a trick to improve their trade."

We all laughed.

"And the Carnival?" inquired Hickman, much amused.

"Carnival!" she snorted.  "A disgraceful exhibition of a town's
lawlessness.  A miserable pageant got up merely to attract the
unsuspecting foreigner into the web spread for him by extortionate
hotel-keepers.  All the so-called fun is performed by paid mountebanks;
the cars are not only inartistic, but there is always something
extremely offensive in their character, while the orgies which take
place at the masked balls at the Casino are absolutely disgraceful.  The
whole thing is artificial, and deserves no support at all from winter
visitors."

Mrs Anson, for once, did not agree with this sweeping condemnation,
while Mabel declared that she always enjoyed the fun of the battles of
flowers and paper confetti, although she admitted that she had never had
the courage to go out on those days when the pellets of lime, or "harp
confetti," are permitted.  Both Hickman and myself supported Mabel in
defence of the annual fetes at Nice as being unique in all the world.

But the Irritating Woman was not to be convinced that her opinions were
either ill-formed or in the least distorted.  She had never been present
at a Carnival ball, she admitted, but it had been described to her by
two estimable ladies who had, and that was, for her, sufficient.  They
were a pair of pious souls, and would, of course, never exaggerate to
the length of a lie.

Dinner over, the ladies retired, and Hickman and myself were left to
smoke and gossip.  He was certainly a very ugly man, and at times
asserted an overbearing superiority in conversation; but having watched
him very closely, I at length arrived at the conclusion that this was
his natural manner, and was not intended to be offensive.  Indeed, ever
since that first moment when I had entered and been introduced, he had
shown himself to be very pleasant and affable towards me.

"Poor Miss Wells!" he laughed, after the door had closed.  "She's so
infernally positive about everything.  It would be as good as an
entertainment to induce her to expound her views upon religious
matters."

"Any argument seems utterly useless," I remarked.

"Do you know Nice well?" he inquired, after reflecting a moment.

"I've spent three winters there," I answered.

"And at Monte Carlo, I suppose?"

"Yes, of course," I responded, laughing.  "I suppose scarcely any man
goes to Nice without going over to Monty and risking a few louis."

"Were you lucky?"

"So, so.  One season I won five thousand francs.  In fact, I've never
lost on the whole season.  I've always left the Riviera with some of the
bank's money."

"Then you can heartily congratulate yourself," he said, "I'm the
reverse.  I generally lose.  Do you believe in any system at roulette?"

"No; they are all frauds," I answered promptly.  "Except one," he
interposed.  "There's one based on the law of averages, which must turn
up in your favour if you're only patient enough.  The reason why it is
so difficult is because it's such a long and tedious affair."

"Explain it," I urged, for a new system that was infallible was, to me,
of greatest interest.  I had, in the days before my blindness, made a
study of the chances at roulette, and had played carefully upon
principles which had, to me, appeared most natural.  The result had been
that with care I had won--not much, it was true--but it was better than
leaving one's money to swell the company's dividends.

"The system," he said, tossing off his glass of curacoa at one gulp, "is
not at all a complicated one.  If you study the permanences of any
table--you can get them from the _Gazette Rose_--you'll find that each
day the largest number of times either colour comes up in succession is
nine.  Now, all you have to do is to go to a table at the opening of the
play, and taking one colour, red or black it makes no difference, stake
upon it, and allow your money to accumulate until it is swept away.  If
the colour you stake upon comes up eight times in succession, and you
have originally staked twenty francs, your gains lying on the table will
amount to two thousand five hundred and sixty francs.  Even then, don't
touch it.  The colour must, in the law of averages, come up nine times
in succession each day, taking the week through.  If it comes up, you'll
win five thousand and twenty francs for the louis you staked, and then
at once leave the table, for it will not come up nine times again that
day.  Of course, this may occur almost at the opening of the play, or
not until the table is near closing, therefore it requires great
patience and constant attendance.  To-day it may not come up nine times,
but it will probably come up nine times on two occasions to-morrow, and
so the average always rights itself."

His theory was certainly a novel one, and impressed me.  There might, I
thought, be something in it.  He had never had patience to try it, he
admitted, but he had gone through a whole year's "permanences," and
found that only on three or four occasions had it failed.

For half an hour or so he sat lucidly explaining the results of his
studies of the game with the air of a practised gambler.  In these I
became at once interested--as every man is who believes he has found the
secret of how to get the right side of the bank; but we were at length
compelled to put down our cigars, and he led the way into the
drawing-room, where the ladies awaited us.

The room was a large, handsome one, elegantly furnished, and lit by two
great lamps, which shed a soft, subdued light from beneath their huge
shades of silk and lace.  Mabel was sitting at the open grand piano, the
shaded candlelight causing the beautiful diamond star in the coils of
her dark-brown hair to flash with a dazzling iridescence, and as I
entered she turned and gave me a sweet smile of welcome.

A second time I glanced around that spacious apartment, then next
instant stood breathless--transfixed.

I could not believe my own eyes.  It seemed absolutely incredible.  Yet
the truth was beyond all doubt.

In the disposition of the furniture, and in the general appointments of
that handsome salon, the home of the woman I so dearly loved, I
recognised the very room which I had once explored with my keen sense of
touch--the room in which had been committed that ghastly, mysterious,
midnight crime!





WHAT I SAW.

"How you men gossip!"  Mabel exclaimed, tingling upon the piano-stool,
and laughing merrily.

"I wasn't aware that we had been very long," I answered, sinking into a
low armchair near her.  "If so, I'm sure I apologise.  The fact is, that
Mr Hickman was explaining a new system of how to break the bank at
Monte Carlo."

"Oh, Mr Hickman!" she cried, turning at once to him.  "Do explain it,
and I'll try it when we go to the Riviera."

"Mabel, my dear," exclaimed her mother, scandalised, "you'll do nothing
of the kind.  You know I don't approve of gambling."

"Oh, I think it's awfully good fun," her daughter declared.

"If you win," I added.

"Of course," she added; then, turning again to Hickman, she induced him
to explain his new and infallible system just as he had explained it to
me.

The trend of the conversation was, however, lost to me.  My ears were
closed to all sound, and now that I reflect I am surprised that I
succeeded in retaining my self-possession.  I know I sat there rigid, as
one held motionless in terror; I only replied in monosyllables to any
remark addressed to me, and I knew instinctively that the colour had
left my countenance.  The discovery was as bewildering as it was
unexpected.

Every detail of that handsome room was exactly as I had pictured it.
The blind, with their keen sense of touch, are quick to form mental
impressions of places and things, and the general character of this
apartment I had riveted upon my mind with the fidelity of a photograph.

The furniture was of gilt, just as I had detected from its smoothness,
and covered with a rich brocade in wide stripes of art green and dull
red-brown--an extremely handsome pattern; the carpet was dark, with a
pile so thick that one's feet fell noiselessly; the three long windows,
covered by heavy curtains of brocade to match the furniture, reached
from the high-painted ceiling to the ground, exactly as I had found them
in my blind gropings.  About the room were two or three tables with
glass tops, in trays beneath which were collections of choice
_bric-a-brac_, including some wonderful Chinese carvings in ivory, while
before the fireplace was spread the great tiger-skin, with paws and head
preserved, which I so well remembered.

I sat there speechless, breathless.  Not a single detail was there
wanting.  Never before, in all my life, had amazement held me so
absolutely dumbfounded.

Close to where I saw was a spacious couch, over the centre of which was
thrown an antimacassar of silken crochet-work.  It was covered with the
same brocade as the rest of the furniture, and I stretched forth my
hand, with feigned carelessness and touched it.  Its contact was the
same, its shape exact; its position in the room identical.

Upon that very couch I had reclined while the foul tragedy had been
enacted in that room.  My head swam; I closed my eyes.  The great gilt
clock, with its pendulum representing the figure of a girl swinging
beneath the trees, standing on the mantelshelf, ticked out low and
musically, just as it had done on that fateful night.  In an instant, as
I sat with head turned from my companions and my eyes shut, the whole of
that tragic scene was re-enacted.  I heard the crash, the woman's
scream, the awe-stricken exclamation that followed in the inner room.  I
heard, too, the low swish of a woman's skirts, the heavy blow struck by
an assassin's hand, and in horror felt the warm life-blood of the
unknown victim as it trickled upon my hand.

Mabel suddenly ran her white fingers over the keys, and the music
brought me back to a realisation of my true position.  I had at length
discovered the actual house in which the mysterious tragedy had been
enacted, and it became impressed upon me that by the exercise of
greatest care I might further be enabled to prosecute secret
investigations to a successful issue, and at length solve the enigma.

My eyes fixed themselves upon the couch.  It was the very spot where I
had rested, sightless, helpless, while those strange events had taken
place about me.  Was it any wonder that I became filled with
apprehensions, or that I sat there petrified as one turned to stone?

The square, dark-green antimacassar had been placed in the exact centre
of the couch, and sewed down in order to keep it in its place.  Where I
was sitting was fortunately in the shadow, and when Mabel commenced
playing I rose--unsteadily I think--and reseated myself upon the couch,
as being more comfortable.  Then, while the woman who held me entranced
played a selection from the "Trovatore," I, unnoticed by the others,
succeeded in breaking the stitches which tacked the antimacassar to the
brocade.  The feat was a difficult one, for one does not care to be
detected tearing the furniture of one's hostess.  Nevertheless, after
ten minutes or so I succeeded in loosening it, and then, as if by the
natural movement of my body, commenced to work aside.

The music ceased, and even though all my attention was now centred upon
my investigations, I congratulated Mabel upon her accurate execution.
Hickman was standing beside her, and together they began to search for
some piece he had requested her to play, while Miss Wells, with her
hearts and elephants jingling, turned to me and commenced to talk.  By
this I was, of course, interrupted; nevertheless, some ten minutes
later, I rose, and naturally turned back to straighten the rumpled
antimacassar.  In doing so I managed to lift it and glance beneath.

In an instant the truth was plain.  Concealed beneath that square of
green crochet-work was a large dark-brown stain upon the brocade.  It
was the mark of the life-blood of that thin, well-dressed, unknown
victim, who had, in an instant, been struck to the heart!

The shock at its discovery caused me to start, but next instant I
smoothed out the antimacassar into its former place without attracting
any attention, and passed across the room with the motive of inspecting
an object which I well remembered discovering when I had made my blind
search.  Upon a pedestal of black marble stood an exquisite little
statuette of a Neapolitan dancing-woman, undoubtedly the work of some
Italian master.  Without pausing to examine it, I took in its every
detail as I passed.  It was exactly as I had felt it, and in the
self-same spot as on that fatal night.

Beside the couch, as I turned again to look, I saw that a large skin rug
had been thrown down.  Without doubt it had been placed there to conceal
the ugly stain of blood upon the carpet.

And yet there, on the scene of one of the foulest and most cowardly
assassinations, we were actually spending the evening quietly, as became
a respectable household.  The thing seemed absolutely incredible.  A
dozen times I endeavoured to persuade myself that the whole discovery
was but a chimera, arising from my disordered imagination.
Nevertheless, it was impossible to disguise from myself the fact that in
every detail the truth was borne out.  In that very room the unknown man
had been struck dead.  The marks of his blood still remained as evidence
of the truth.

I saw that beside the high lamps at that moment in use, there was a
magnificent candelabra suspended from the ceiling, and in this were
electric lamps.  Then, at the door, I noticed the switch, and knew that
it was the same which I had heard turned off by the assassin before
leaving the house.

At the end of the room, too, were the folding doors, now concealed by
curtains.  It was through those very doors that Edna, my mysterious
protectress, had passed and repassed to that inner room whence had come
the sound of champagne being uncorked and the woman's piercing scream.

Mabel leaned over and spoke to me, whereupon I sank again into the chair
I had previously occupied.  She began to chat, but although her
beautiful eyes held me fixed, and her face seemed more handsome than any
I had ever seen, the diamonds in her hair dazzled my eyes, and I fear
that my responses were scarcely intelligible.

"You are not quite yourself to-night, I think," she remarked at last,
rising from the piano, and taking the low chair that I drew up for her.
"Are you unwell?"

"Why?"  I asked, laughing.

"Because you look rather pale.  What's the matter?"

"Nothing," I answered, as carelessly as I could.  "A slight headache.
But it has passed now."

My eyes wandered to those curtains of green plush.  How I longed to
enter that room beyond!

At that moment she took out her handkerchief.  Even that action added to
the completion of the mental picture I had formed.  Her tiny square of
lawn and lace exhaled a sweet odour.  It was that of _peau d'Espagne_,
the same subtle perfume used by the mysterious Edna!  It filled my
nostrils until I seemed intoxicated by its fragrance combined with her
beauty.

Her dress was discreetly _decollete_, and as she sat chatting to me with
that bright vivaciousness which was so charming, her white neck slowly
heaved and fell.  She had, it seemed, been striving all the evening to
get a tete-a-tete chat with me, but the chatter of that dreadful
Irritating Woman and the requests made by Hickman had prevented her.

As she gossiped with me, now and then waving her big feather fan, she
conveyed to my mind an impression of extreme simplicity in the midst of
the most wonderful complexity.  She seemed to take the peculiar traits
from many characters, and so mingle them that, like the combination of
hues in a sunbeam, the effect was as one to the eye.  I had studied her
carefully each time we had met, and had found that she had something of
the romantic enthusiasm of a Juliet, of the truth and constancy of a
Helen, of the dignified purity of an Isabel, of the tender sweetness of
a Viola, of the self-possession and intellect of a Portia--combined
together so equally and so harmoniously that I could scarcely say that
one quality predominated over the other.  Her dignity was imposing, and
stood rather upon the defensive; her submission, though unbounded, was
not passive, and thus she stood wholly distinct in her sweetness from
any woman I had ever met.

The following day was one on which she was due to take her music-lesson,
and I inquired whether I might, as usual, meet her and escort her across
the Park.

"You are really very kind," she responded; "but I fear I take up far too
much of your time."

"Not at all," I hastened to assure her.  "I always enjoy our walks
together."

She smiled, but a moment later said--

"I fear that I shall be prevented from going to Hanover Square
to-morrow, as I shall be making calls with mother.  We've been
neglecting to call of late, and have such a host to make."

"Then I shan't see you at all to-morrow?"  I said in deep
disappointment.

"No, I fear not," she answered.  "As a matter of fact, my movements for
the next few days are rather uncertain."

"But you'll write and tell me when you are free?"  I urged earnestly.

"If you wish," she responded, smiling sweetly.  Apparently she was in no
wise averse to my companionship, a fact which had become to me more
apparent now that she had induced her mother to invite me to their
table.

I endeavoured to extract from her some appointment, but she only
whispered--

"Remember that our meetings are clandestine.  Don't let them overhear
us.  Let's change the subject."  And then she began to discuss several
of the latest novels.

She had apparently a wide knowledge of French fiction, for she explained
how a friend of hers, an old schoolfellow, who had married a French
baron and lived in Paris, sent her regularly all the notable novels.  Of
English fiction, too, she was evidently a constant reader, for she told
me much about recent novels that I was unaware of, and criticised style
in a manner which betrayed a deep knowledge of her subject.

"One would almost think you were a lady novelist, or a book-reviewer," I
remarked, in response to a sweeping condemnation which she made
regarding the style of a much-belauded writer.

"Well, personally, I like books with some grit in them," she declared.
"I can't stand either the so-called problem novel, or a story
interlarded with dialect.  If any one wants nasty problems, let them
spend a few shillings in the works of certain French writers, who turn
out books on the most unwholesome themes they can imagine, and fondly
believe themselves realists.  We don't want these _queue-de-siecle_
works in England.  Let us stick to the old-fashioned story of love,
adventure, or romance.  English writers are now beginning to see the
mistake they once made in trying to follow the French style, and are
turning to the real legitimate novel of action--the one that interests
and grips from the first page to the last."

She spoke sensibly, and I expressed my entire accord with her opinion.
But this discussion was only in order to hide our exchange of
confidences uttered in an undertone while Hickman and the two ladies
were chatting at the further end of the room.

All the time I was longing to get a sight of the interior of the
adjoining apartment, the room whence had burst forth that woman's
agonised cry in the stillness of the night.  I racked my brain to find
some means of entering there, but could devise none.  A guest can hardly
wander over his hostess's house on the first occasion he receives an
invitation.  Besides, to betray any interest in the house might, I
reflected, arouse some suspicion.  To be successful in these inquiries
would necessitate the most extreme caution.

The fragrant odour of _peau d'Espagne_ exhaled by her chiffons seemed to
hold me powerless.

The gilt clock with its swinging girl had already struck eleven on its
silver bell, and been re-echoed by another clock in the hall playing the
Westminster chimes, when suddenly Mrs Anson, with a book in her hand,
looked across to her daughter, saying--

"Mabel, dear, I've left my glasses on the table in the library.  Will
you kindly fetch them for me?"

In an instant I saw my chance, and, jumping to my feet, offered to
obtain them.  At first she objected, but finding me determined, said--

"The library is the next room, there.  You'll find them on the
writing-table.  Mother always leaves them there.  It's really too bad to
thus make a servant of you.  I'll ring for Arnold."

"No, no," I protested, and at once went eagerly in search of them.





THE INNER ROOM.

The adjoining room was, I found, in the front part of the house--a
rather small one, lined on one side with books, but furnished more as a
boudoir than a library, for there were several easy-chairs, a
work-table, and a piano in a corner.  At this instrument the mysterious
player had on that night sat executing Chopin's "Andante-Spinato" the
moment before it became interrupted by some tragic and unexpected
spectacle.  I glanced around and noted that the furniture and carpet
were worn and faded, that the books were dusty and evidently unused, and
that the whole place presented an air of neglect, and had nothing
whatever in keeping with the gorgeousness of the other handsome
apartments.

The glasses were, as Mrs Anson had said, lying beside the blotting-pad
upon a small rosewood writing-table.  I took them up, and, having made a
tour of inspection, was about to leave the place, when suddenly, on the
top of some books upon a shelf close to the door, I espied a small
volume.

The curious incident of the birthday book occurred to me; therefore I
took down the little volume and found that it really was a birthday
book.  No name was inscribed on the title-page as owner, but there were
many names scribbled therein.  In swift eagerness I turned to the page
of my own birthday--the 2nd of July.  It was blank.

I stood pondering with the book still in my hand.  The absence of my
name there proved one or two things, either I had not signed a birthday
book at all, or, if I had, it was not the one I had discovered.  Now,
there are frequently two birthday-books in one house, therefore I
resolved, ere I gave the matter reflection, to prosecute my
investigations further and ascertain whether there was not a second
book.

With this object I made a second tour around the room, noting the
position of every article of furniture.  Some music lay scattered beside
the piano, and, on turning it over, I found the actual copy of Chopin's
"Andante" which had been played on the night of the tragedy.  The cover
had been half torn away, but, on examining it closely beneath the light,
I detected plainly a small smear of blood upon it.

Truly the house was one of mystery.  In that room several persons had
drunk champagne on that memorable night when blind Fate led me thither;
in that room a woman had, according to the man's shout of alarm, been
foully done to death, although of this latter fact I was not altogether
sure.  At any rate, however, it was plain that some tragic event had
previously taken place there, as well as in that room beyond where I had
reclined blind and helpless.  It was strange also that the apartment
should remain neglected and undusted, as though the occupants
entertained some dislike to it.  But I had been absent long enough, and,
returning to the drawing-room with the missing glasses, handed them to
Mrs Anson.

Hickman had, in my absence, crossed to Mabel, and was sitting beside her
in earnest conversation, therefore I was compelled to seat myself with
my hostess and the Irritating Woman and chat with them.  But ere long I
contrived again to reach the side of the woman whom I adored, and to
again press her for an appointment.

"It is far better forme to write to you," she answered, beneath her
breath.  "As I've told you, we have so many calls to make and cards to
leave."

"Your mother tells me that you have a box for the Prince of Wales's on
Saturday night, and has asked me to join you," I said.  Her eyes
brightened, and I saw that she was delighted at the prospect.  But she
expressed a hope that I wouldn't be bored.

"Bored!"  I echoed.  "Why, I'm never bored when in your company.  I fear
that it's the other way about--that I bore you."

"Certainly not," she responded decisively.  "I very soon contrive to
give persons who are bores their _conge_.  Mother accuses me of rudeness
to them sometimes, but I assure you I really can't help being positively
insulting.  Has mother asked you to dine on Saturday?"

"Yes," I answered.  "But shan't I see you before then?"

"No; I think it is very unlikely.  We'll have a jolly evening on
Saturday."

"But I enjoy immensely those walks across the Park," I blurted forth in
desperation.

"And I also," she admitted with a sweet frankness.  "But this week it is
utterly impossible to make any arrangements."

Mention of the theatre afforded me an opportunity of putting to her a
question upon which, during the past couple of hours, I had reflected
deeply.

"You've, of course, been to the Exhibition at Earl's Court, living here
in the immediate vicinity," I said.

"I've only been once," she answered.  "Although we've had this house
nearly two years, exhibitions don't appeal to me very much.  I was there
at night, and the gardens were prettily illuminated, I thought."

"Yes," I said.  "With the exception of the gardens, there is far too
much pasteboard scenic effect.  I suppose you noticed that serrated line
of mountains over which the eternal switchback runs?  Those self-same
mountains, repainted blue, grey, or purple, with tips of snow, have,
within my personal knowledge, done duty as the Alps, the Pyrenees, the
Rockies, and the Atlas, not counting half a dozen other notable ranges."

She laughed, slowly fanning herself the while.

By her reply I had obtained from her own lips a most important fact in
the inquiry I intended now to prosecute, namely, that this house had
been her home for nearly two years.  Therefore it had been in Mrs
Anson's possession at the time of the tragedy.

Since the moment when I had first recognised that; room as the one in
which I had been present on the night of the mysterious assassination,
the possibility had more than once occurred to me that Mrs Anson might
have; unwittingly taken it ready furnished after the committal of the
crime.  Such, however, was not the fact.  Mabel had asserted that for
nearly two years she had lived, there.

Again, even as I sat there at her side, deep in admiration of her
magnificent figure in that striking toilette of coral-pink, with its
soft garniture of lace and chiffons, I could not help reflecting upon
the curious fact that she should have recognised the dead man's
pencil-case.  And she had, by her silence, assented to my suggestion
that he had been her lover.  That little gold pencil-case that I had
found in his pocket when he lay dead at that very spot where we were now
sitting had been one of her love-gifts to him.

The mystery hourly grew more puzzling and bewildering.  Yet so also each
hour that I was at her side I fell deeper and deeper in love with her,
longing always for opportunity to declare to her the secret of my heart,
yet ever fearing to do so lest she should turn from me.

Our unexpected meeting at Grosvenor Gate, after I had received that
letter from my anonymous correspondent, combined with the startling
discovery that it was actually in her house that the mysterious tragedy
had been enacted; that in that very room the smart, refined young man
who had been her lover had fought so fiercely for life, and had yet been
struck down so unerringly, formed an enigma inscrutable and perplexing.

The mystery, however, did not for one moment cause me to waver in my
affection for her.  I had grown to love her fondly and devotedly; to
adore her as my idol, as the one who held my whole future in her hands,
therefore whatever suspicion arose within my mind--and I admit that
grave suspicion did arise on many occasions--I cast it aside and fell
down to worship at the shrine of her incomparable beauty.

Miss Wells's carriage was announced at last, and the Irritating Woman,
tinkling and jingling, rose with a wearied sigh and took her leave,
expressing her thanks for "a most delightful evening, my dear."

Mabel, mischievous as a school-girl, pulled a grimace when the music of
the bangles had faded in the hall outside, at which we laughed in merry
chorus.

With Hickman I remained ten minutes or so longer, then rose, also
declaring that it was time we left.  The grave man-servant Arnold served
us with whiskies and sodas in the dining-room, and, Mabel having helped
me on with my covert-coat, we shook hands with our hostess and her
daughter, and left in company.

The night was bright and starlit, and the air refreshing.  Turning to
the left after leaving the house, we came immediately to a road which
gave entrance to that secluded oval called The Boltons.  I looked at the
name-plate, and saw it was named Gilston Road.  It must have been at
this corner that I had been knocked down by a passing cab when, on my
first adventurous journey alone, I had wandered so far westward.

I turned to look back, and noticed that from the dining-room window of
the house we had just left any occurrence at the corner in question
could be distinctly seen.  Edna had explained that she had witnessed my
accident from that window, and in this particular had apparently told me
the truth.

The remarkable and unexpected discoveries of that evening had produced a
veritable tumult of thoughts within my brain, and as I walked with
Hickman I took no note of his merry, irresponsible gossip, until he
remarked--

"You're a bit preoccupied, I think.  You're pondering over Mabel's good
looks, I suppose?"

"No," I answered, starting at this remark.  Then, to excuse myself, I
added, "I was thinking of other things.  I really beg your pardon."

"I was asking your opinion of Mabel.  Don't you consider her extremely
handsome?"

"Of course," I answered, trying to suppress my enthusiasm.  "She's
charming."

"A splendid pianist, too."

"Excellent."

"It has always been a wonder to me that she has never become engaged,"
he remarked.  "A girl with her personal charms ought to make an
excellent match."

"Has she never been engaged?"  I inquired quickly, eager to learn the
truth about her from this man, who was evidently an old friend of the
family.

"Never actually engaged.  There have been one or two little
love-affairs, I've heard, but none of them was really serious."

"He'd be a lucky fellow who married her," I remarked, still striving to
conceal the intense interest I felt.

"Lucky!" he echoed.  "I should rather think so, in many ways.  It is
impossible for a girl of her beauty and nobility of character to go
about without lots of fellows falling in love with her.  Yet I happen to
know that she holds them all aloof, without even a flirtation."

I smiled at this assertion of his, and congratulated myself that I was
the only exception; for had she not expressed pleasure at my
companionship on her walks?  But recollecting her admission that the
victim of the assassin's knife had been her lover, I returned to the
subject, in order to learn further facts.

"Who were the men with whom she had the minor love-affairs--any one I
know?"  I inquired.

"I think not, because it all occurred before they returned to live in
England," he answered.

"Then you knew them abroad?"

"Slightly.  We met in a casual sort of way at Pau, on the Riviera, and
elsewhere."

"Both mother and daughter are alike extremely pleasant," I said.  "In
high spirits Mrs Anson is sometimes almost as juvenile as Mabel."

"Quite so," he laughed.  "One would never believe that she's nearly
sixty.  She's as vivacious and merry as a woman half her age.  I've
myself been surprised at her sprightliness often and often."

Again and again I endeavoured to turn the conversation back to the
identity of Mabel's former lover, but he either did not know or
purposely refused to tell me.  He spoke now and then with an intentional
vagueness, as though his loyalty to the Ansons prevented him from
betraying any confidences reposed in him as a friend of the family.
Indeed, this cautiousness showed him to be a trustworthy man, and his
character became thereby strengthened in my estimation.  On first
acquaintance I had instantly experienced a violent aversion to him, but
now, on this walk together along the Fulham Road, I felt that we should
probably end by becoming friends.

He walked with long strides and a swinging, easy gait that seemed almost
military, while his air of careless merriment as he laughed and joked,
smoking the choice cigar which the man had handed to him in the hall
just before our departure, gave him the aspect of an easy-going
man-about-town.

"I fully expect, my dear fellow," he laughed--"I fully expect that
you'll be falling in love with the pretty Mabel if you're in her company
very much."

"You're chaffing," I protested, echoing his laugh.

"Not at all," he asserted.  "Only take care.  Love-making with her is a
dangerous pastime--devilish dangerous, I assure you."

"Dangerous to the man's heart--eh?"

"Yes," he responded in a vague tone, glancing at me curiously; "if you
like to put it in that way."

We had passed from the Fulham Road into the King's Road, Chelsea, and at
that moment he halted suddenly at the corner of a street of high,
regularly built houses, most of which were in darkness, saying--"I live
down here.  Come in and have a final whisky and soda with me; then you
can take a cab back to the Strand.  There are cabs all night on the rank
in Sloane Square."

"I fear it's too late," I protested, glancing at my watch, and finding
it past one o'clock.

"No, no, my dear fellow, come along," he urged.  "You'll want a drink
before you get home;" and, thus persuaded, I accompanied him up the
street to one of the high houses, each exactly similar to its neighbour,
with a flight of hearthstoned steps leading up to its front door, and a
deep, grimy basement protected by a few yards of iron railings.

In the hall, although the gas had been extinguished, there remained a
small hand-lamp alight, evidently placed there for his use.  This he
took, and conducted me to a front room, upon what the landlady of such a
residence would term her "drawing-room floor."  The house smelled close
and stuffy; the furniture of the sitting-room was covered with plush
which had once been crimson, but which was now sadly worn and badly
moth-eaten; the threadbare carpet had been perforated in many places by
hot cigarette-ends carelessly thrown down, and there was a general air
of disorder about the place which seemed incongruous with my friend's
smart air and general demeanour.  I believed him to be a gentleman, yet
found that he lived in a not over-clean lodging.  To the practical
Londoner, whose fate it is to live in "diggings," apartments in the
neighbourhood of the King's Road are notable as being both dear and
dirty.

He threw off his overcoat, tossed his hat aside, and pulled up a long,
comfortable wicker-chair for me.  Then he opened the buffet, and took
therefrom a bottle of whisky and a couple of sodas, with which he
proceeded to mix the drinks, his cigar-stump still in his mouth, even
though he talked all the time, recounting some amusing stories which
caused me to laugh.

I could not quite make him out.  The remarks he let fall while, over our
coffee, we had discussed the chances at roulette, led me to the
suspicion that he was a practised gambler, and here in his rooms I
detected evidence that he was fond of sport, of betting, and of other
games of hazard.

We had lit fresh cigars from his own box, and as he sat in his big
armchair he lifted his glass to me merrily, expressing pleasure at our
meeting.

"I hope," he added, "that we shall meet very often.  But take my tip, my
dear fellow, and don't fall in love with Mabel Anson."

Why he should emphasise this warning just as Channing had done struck me
as very curious.  It might be, of course, that he was in love with her
himself, and regarded me as a possible rival.  This, indeed, was the
impression conveyed to me by his words, and it aroused within me a vague
feeling of distrust.  That quick sinister glance when I had been
introduced still lingered in my memory.

"I can't think why you should so repeatedly warn me," I remarked,
laughing with affected amusement.  "It really isn't likely that I shall
fall in love with her."

He made no response.  He only puffed slowly at his cigar, and smiled
cynically through the veil of smoke he created.

I replaced my cigar in my mouth--for my friend was evidently a
connoisseur of Havanas, and this was an excellent one--but at that
instant my tongue, as I twisted it in my mouth, came in contact with the
cut end of the weed, and I felt pricked as if by some sharp point.
Quickly I removed it and examined it closely, exclaiming--

"Do they wrap up needles in your cigars?  Look!"  And I passed it across
to him, indicating where, protruding from the end, which I had chopped
off with the cutter on my watchguard, was the tiny point of either a
needle or a pin.

"Extraordinary!" he ejaculated, taking it from my hand and examining it
carefully.

But ere a few moments had elapsed I felt a strange sensation creeping
upon me; a curious chilliness ran down my spine, my tongue seemed
swelling until it filled my mouth, and my brain felt aflame.

"God?"  I cried, springing to my feet in alarm.  "Why, I believe I'm
poisoned!"

"Nonsense!" he laughed.  His voice seemed to sound afar off, and I saw
his dog's face slowly assume an expression of evil as he sat opposite,
intently watching me.

A sudden dizziness seized me; a spasm of sharp pain shot through all my
limbs from head to toe; my senses reeled, I could see nothing
distinctly.  The man Hickman's ugly visage seemed slowly to fade in a
blurred, blood-red mist.

At that same instant my blood was frozen by terror, for I felt convinced
that this abrasion of my tongue had been planned by my companion's
devilish ingenuity, and that upon that needle-point had been placed some
baneful substance, the action of which was rapid and certain.  I saw it
all, now that it was, alas! too late.

With a wild cry I stretched forth both hands to steady myself, but,
staggering, only clutched the air.

Then a strange and utterly unaccountable thing happened to me--stranger
than has ever happened to any other living man.





THE MARBLE HAND.

I approach this and the following chapters of my secret personal history
with feelings of amazement and of thankfulness that I should still be
alive and able to write down the truth freely and without fear, for the
events were certainly most remarkable and utterly mystifying.

In no man's history has there ever been such a strange, bewildering page
as the one I am about to reveal to you.

Reader, as I have taken you into my confidence, so also I tell you
confidentially that I myself, an ordinary man, would never have believed
that in this life of ours such things were possible, had I not myself
experienced them, and personally endured the frightful agony of mind
which they entailed.  But I am writing down in black and white upon
these pages the solid unvarnished facts, fearless of contradiction, so
that the whole of the strange truth shall be known, and hat she who is
dearest to me on earth may be adjudged by the world with fairness and
with justice.  For that sole reason I have resolved to relate this
romance of real life, otherwise it would ever remain in that crabbed
writing in that small portfolio, or secret dossier as it is called,
numbered, docketed, and reposing in the archives of the Ministry of the
Interior of a certain European Power.

Well, I have written the truth here, so that all who read may judge.

Immediately after the slight abrasion of my tongue, caused by the
scratch of the needle so cunningly concealed in the cigar, I must have
lost all consciousness.  Of that I have no doubt.  The recollections I
have are only the faintest ones, blurred and indistinct, like shadows in
a dream.  I remember shouting in alarm and fighting fiercely against the
drowsiness and general debility which seemed to overcome me, but all was
with little or no effect.  The last I remember was the ugly face of
Hickman glaring evilly into mine.  His hideous grin seemed to render his
dog's face the more repulsive, and his laugh of triumph sounded in my
ears harsh and discordant, showing plainly that the spirit of murder was
in his heart.

At the same instant that I had made a movement towards him, I seemed to
have received a stunning blow upon the top of the skull, which so dulled
my senses that I was powerless to combat the curious giddiness that
seized me, and sank senseless upon the floor of that shabby room,
helpless as a log.

The last thought that surged through my brain was the reflection that I
was powerless in the hands of an enemy.  My first estimate of this man
Hickman had been correct, and I regretted that I did not allow my
instinctive caution to overrule my desire to become on friendly terms
with him.  He had enticed me to that place with an evil purpose--
possibly that I might share the same fate as did that young man on the
fateful night at The Boltons.

The prick of an ordinary needle upon the tongue would never have created
such an electrical effect upon me, therefore it was certain that the
point had been smeared with some powerful drug or poison.  The ingenuity
with which the cigar had been prepared was shown by the fact that a
needle placed within would, as the tobacco became moistened by the
saliva, gradually work downward towards the tongue, while the heat at
the further end of the needle would, of course, render liquid any
coating placed upon it.  Without doubt I had been the victim of a
deeply-laid plot, prepared with a cunning that seemed almost beyond
comprehension.

The blank in my mind, caused by my sudden unconsciousness, did not
appear to me to be of very long duration.  All I know is that I was
utterly ignorant of every event that transpired about me, and knew
nothing whatever of any of the incidents which afterwards took place in
that dark, obscure house, or elsewhere.  And yet they must have been of
a character absolutely unheard of.

I have said that the period of my benighted senses did not appear to be
prolonged.  Indeed, now on reflection in the calmness of the present, I
am inclined to put down the lapse of time during which, in my
estimation, I was lost to all knowledge of things about me at two, or
perhaps three, hours.  Of course, it is difficult to fix time when we
awaken after sleeping, except by the degree of light in the heavens.  If
it is still dark, it is always difficult to gauge the hour.  So it was
with me when, with a heavy, bruised feeling about the top of my skull, I
slowly struggled back to a knowledge of the world.

My first thought as I opened my eyes was of Hickman.  My second was a
feeling of surprise that I had been unconscious so long, for while it
was about two o'clock in the morning when my tongue had, been pricked by
the concealed needle, and my adversary had dealt me a crushing blow upon
my skull as I had rushed upon him, yet straight before my eyes the sun
was shining full upon the carpet, and the particles of dust were dancing
in its golden rays.

Surely, I thought, I could not have remained unconscious for nearly
twelve hours.

The pain in my skull was excruciating.  I put my hand to the wound, and
when I withdrew it found blood upon it.  I felt a huge bump, but the
abrasion of the skin was, I discovered, only slight.

At first my brain was confused and puzzled, as though my dulled senses
were wrapped in cotton wool.  At a loss to account for the time that had
elapsed, I lay upon the carpet just as I was, in vague, ignorant
wonderment.  My eyes, dazzled by the bright sunlight, pained me, and I
closed them.  Perhaps I dozed.  Of that I am not quite sure.  All I know
is that when I opened my eyes again the pain in my head seemed better,
and my senses seemed gradually to recognise, appreciate, and perceive.

I was lying on my side upon the carpet, and slowly, with a careful
effort involuntarily made by the march of intellect, I gazed around me.

The place was unfamiliar--utterly unfamiliar.  I wondered if I were
actually dreaming.  I felt my head, and again glanced at my hand.  No.
There was sufficient proof that my skull had been injured, and that I
was lying alone in that room with the bar of sunlight slanting straight
before my eyes.

Gradually, and not without considerable difficulty--for I was still
half-dazed--I made out the objects about me, and became aware of my
surroundings.

My eyes were amazed at every turn.  Whereas Hickman's apartment was a
dirty, shabby lodging-house sitting-room of that stereotyped kind so
well known to Londoners, the place wherein I found myself was a rather
large, handsomely furnished drawing-room, the two long windows of which
opened out upon a wide lawn, with a park and a belt of high trees far
beyond.  From where I was I could see a wealth of roses, and across the
lawn I saw the figure of a woman in a white summer blouse.

The carpet whereon I was stretched was soft and rich, the furniture was
of ebony, with gilt ornamentations--I think French, of the Empire
period--while close to me was a grand piano, and upon a chair beside it
a woman's garden hat.

I looked at that hat critically.  It belonged to a young woman, no
doubt, for it was big and floppy, of soft yellow straw, with cherries,
and had strings to tie beneath the chin.  I pictured its owner as pretty
and attractive.

About that room there were screens from Cairo, little inlaid
coffee-tables from Algiers, quaint wood-carvings of the Madonna beneath
glass shades, fashioned by the peasants of Central Russia, Italian
statuary, and modern French paintings.  The room seemed almost a museum
of souvenirs of cosmopolitan travel.  Whoever was its owner, he
evidently knew the value of _bric-a-brac_, and had picked up his
collection in cities far afield.

The door was closed, and over it hung a rich _portiere_ of dark-blue
plush edged with gold.  The sculptured over-mantel, in white marble,
was, I quickly detected, a replica of one I had seen and admired in the
Bargello, in Florence.  One object, however, aroused my wonder.  It was
lying on the floor straight before me, an object in white marble, the
sculptured arm of a woman with the index-finger outstretched.  The limb
was of life-size proportions, and had apparently been broken off at the
elbow.

I staggered unevenly to my feet, in order to further pursue my
investigations, and then I saw, upon a pedestal close to me, the marble
figure of a Phryne with its arm broken.

In the centre of that handsome apartment I stood and gazed wonderingly
around.  My transition from that bizarre sitting-room in Chelsea to this
house, evidently in the country, had been effected in a manner beyond
comprehension.  My surprising surroundings caused my weakened brain to
reel again.  I was without hat or overcoat, and as I glanced down at my
trousers they somehow did not seem to be the same that I had been
wearing on the previous night.

Instinctively I felt that only by some extraordinary and mysterious
means could I have been conveyed from that close-smelling lodging in
Chelsea to this country mansion.  The problem uppermost in my mind was
the identity of the place where I had thus found myself on recovering my
senses, and how I got there.

My eyes fell upon the push of an electric-bell.  My position, lying
there injured upon the carpet, demanded explanation, and without further
hesitation I walked across and pressed the ivory button.

I heard no sound.  The bell must have rung far away, and this gave me
the idea that the house was a large one.

Intently I listened, and a few minutes later heard a footstep.  The door
opened, and an elderly man-servant, with grey whiskers, appeared in the
entry asking--"Did you ring, sir?"

"Yes," I answered.  "Will you kindly inform me where I am?"

He regarded me with a strange, puzzled expression, and then, in alarm,
he rushed forward to me, crying--"Why, sir!  You've hurt your head!
Look!  You're covered with blood!"

His grey face was pale, and for an instant he stood regarding me
open-mouthed.

"Can't you answer my question?"  I demanded hastily.  "I know that I've
injured my head.  I didn't call you in order to learn that.  I want to
know where I am."

The man's countenance slowly assumed a terrified expression as he
regarded me, and then, without further word, he flew from the room as
fast as his legs could carry him.  I heard him shouting like a lunatic,
in some other part of the house, and stood utterly dumbfounded at his
extraordinary behaviour.  He had escaped from my presence as though he
had seen an apparition.

A few minutes later, however, he returned, accompanied by a dark-haired,
well-dressed man of about thirty, tall, rather good-looking, and
apparently a gentleman.  The instant the latter saw me he rushed
forward, crying, in a voice of distress--

"Oh, my dear sir, whatever has happened?"

"My head," I explained.  "It was that ugly-faced scoundrel Hickman.
Where is he?"

"Hickman?" echoed the new-comer.  "Hickman?  Who's he?"

"Oh, it's all very well for you to pretend to know nothing about it," I
cried angrily.  "But I tell you that as soon as I'm able I'll apply for
a warrant for his arrest on a charge of attempted murder.  Last night he
tried to kill me."

"I don't understand you," the stranger responded.  "I don't, of course,
expect you to admit any complicity in the affair," I snapped.  "You'd be
a fool if you did.  All I tell you is that an attempt has been made upon
my life by a man to whom I was introduced as Hickman."

"Not in this room?"

I hesitated.

"No, not in this room," I admitted.  "It was in a house at Chelsea."

The young man exchanged meaning glances with the man-servant.

"At Chelsea!" repeated the stranger.  "In London?"

"In London."

"Well, that's very curious," he remarked.  Then, turning to the servant,
said--

"Gill, go and fetch Doctor Britten at once.  Say nothing of this to any
one in the house."

"Yes, sir," answered the servant, who instantly withdrew.

"I suppose you've sent for the doctor to bandage my head?"  I remarked
cynically.  "I'm perfectly competent to do that if you'll kindly oblige
me with a little warm water, a sponge, and some clean old linen."

"No, no," he urged.  "Wait in patience until Britten comes.  He'll be
here in a moment.  I saw him returning home only ten minutes ago."

"But how came I here?"  I demanded.

He hesitated, regarding me with evident distrust, mingled with
considerable alarm.

"I--I really don't know," he responded lamely.

"That's all nonsense," I cried, with more force than politeness.  "I
find myself here, in this room, wounded and weak through loss of blood,
after having been half murdered, and then you have the cool impudence to
deny all knowledge of how I came here.  You're a liar--that's plain."

I had grown angry at this lame attempt of his to feign ignorance.

"You are extremely complimentary," he answered, colouring slightly.

"Well, perhaps you won't mind telling me the time.  I find that that
cunning scoundrel Hickman, not content with trying to poison me with a
prepared cigar and striking me on the head in that cowardly way, has
also robbed me of my watch and chain."

He glanced at his watch.

"It's half-past two," he answered abruptly.

"Half-past two!  Then it happened more than twelve hours ago," I
observed.

"I wish Britten would hurry," the young man remarked.  "I don't like the
look of that wound.  It's such a very nasty place."

"Only a scalp-wound," I said lightly.  "Properly bandaged, it will be
all right in a few days.  There's fortunately no fracture."

"Well, you're in a pretty mess, at any rate."

"And so would you be," I said, "if you had been entrapped as I've been."

His face seemed bloodless, as though the discovery of my presence there
had caused him the utmost alarm.  He fidgeted and glanced eagerly now
and then towards the door.

At last I distinguished advancing footsteps, and there entered an
elderly, dapper, white-bearded little man, whose general demeanour and
buttoned frock-coat gave him the air of the medical practitioner.  He
held his silk hat in his hand, and as he placed it down I noticed that
his stethoscope reposed cross-wise in the lining.

"My dear sir!  My dear sir!  What's this?" he began fussily.  "Come, sit
down;" and he drew me towards a chair, and seated himself upon the edge
of another close to me.

"My head has been injured.  Examine for yourself."

"Ah!" he exclaimed, first regarding me fixedly, and then rising and
examining my head.  "A nasty scalp-wound, I see."  He felt it carefully
with his fingers, causing me a sharp twinge of pain.  "No fracture, no
fracture.  That's fortunate--very fortunate.  It's not serious at all,
I'm glad to tell you--nothing serious.  How did it occur?"

"I was struck, that's all I remember," I answered, turning to him and
looking into his face.

"With something sharp-pointed, evidently;" and he looked extremely
puzzled.

"I don't know what it was."

"From what I can feel, I think you must have had a previous blow upon
the same spot at some time or another.  Do you remember it?"

"Not at all," I answered.  "I once received a blow on the head by the
kick of a horse, but it was at the side."

"Ah, perhaps this was a blow in infancy, and you don't recollect it."

Then, as he exchanged a strange look with the young man who stood eager
and anxious at his side, his quick eyes suddenly fell upon the broken
arm of the statue.

"Why, what's this?" he cried, a sudden light apparently dawning upon
him.  "Look here, there's blood and hair upon this marble finger.
You've evidently struck your head against it in passing, and so
violently as to break the marble.  See!"

I looked, and there, sure enough upon the outstretched index-finger of
the marble hand was a trace of blood, to which two or three hairs still
clung.

"We've solved the mystery!" he cried.  "I must dress your wound, and
then, my dear sir, you must rest--rest.  It will do your head good, you
know."

"But I was struck down last night by a man named Hickman in his rooms at
Chelsea.  He attempted to murder me."

"Yes, yes," he said, as though intentionally humouring me.  "We've heard
all about that.  But come with me upstairs and let me dress your wound
at once.  Gill," he added, turning to the servant, "get me some lukewarm
water at once."

Then he took my arm and led me upstairs to a well-fitted dressing-room,
where he fussily washed and bandaged my head, while I sat silent, dazed,
and wondering.





MYSTERY INEXPLICABLE.

Britten was, I immediately detected, one of those men whose well-feigned
air of fussy sympathy, whose unruffled good humour, and whose quick
perception enabled him to gauge to a nicety his patient's character, and
to thus ingratiate himself.  By the younger people he was, no doubt,
pronounced clever on account of his age and known experience, while old
ladies--those whose very life depended upon regularly seeing the
doctor--declared him to be "such a dear, kind man."  Upon the family
doctor's manner alone depends the extent of his popularity and the size
of his practice.  The most ignorant charlatan who ever held a diploma
can acquire a wide practice if he is only shrewd enough to humour his
patients, to take pains to feign the deepest interest in every case, and
assume an outward show of superior knowledge.  In medicine be the man
ever so clever, if he has no tact with his patients his surgery bell
will remain for ever silent.

Dr Britten was a shrewd old fellow; a bit of a bungler, who made up for
all defects by that constant good humour which people like in a medical
man.  "Don't worry, my dear sir; don't worry," he urged, when he had
finished.  "Rest well, and you'll be right again very soon."

"But the events of last night?"  I said.  "A man made a dastardly
attempt upon my life, and I intend to secure his arrest."

"Yes, yes, I know," he answered, patting me on the shoulder with a
familiarity curious when I reflected that I had never set eyes upon him
till half an hour before.  "But take my advice, and don't reflect upon
it."

"If you know, then perhaps you'll kindly give me some explanation?"  I
said, resenting his manner.  He was treating me as he would a child.

"I only know what you've told me," he responded.  "It's a strange story,
certainly.  But don't you think that it is, greater part of it,
imagination?"

"Imagination!"  I cried, starting up angrily.  "I tell you, Doctor
Britten--or whatever your name is--that it is no imagination.  The wound
on my head is sufficient proof of that."

"The wound was inflicted by yourself," he answered calmly.  "You
accidentally ran against the statue."

"I don't believe it," I said, bluntly.  "It's all a confounded
conspiracy, and, moreover, you are staking your professional reputation
by assisting in it."

He shrugged his shoulders and raised his grey eyebrows with an
expression of regret.

"I have been called to you, my dear sir, because you have met with an
accident," he said.  "I have merely given you the best of my advice--
namely, to remain quiet, and not trouble about anything that has passed.
Your brain requires rest after the severe shock it has received."

"Doctor Britten," I said determinedly, "I quite understand the meaning
of your vague words.  You believe that I'm not quite right in my mind."

"No, no," he assured me quickly.  "I did not say that.  Pray do not
misunderstand me.  I merely advise rest and perfect quiet.  Indeed, you
would be far better in bed for a few days--far better."

"I know my own feelings best, thanks," I replied, for his manner,
although it might impress nervous old ladies, aroused within me a strong
resentment.

"Exactly.  But surely you should, for your own sake, attend to the
suggestions of your medical adviser?"

"You have formed wrong conclusions--entirely wrong conclusions," I
laughed.  "Is it likely that I shall take notice of anything you say
when you believe that I'm not responsible for my actions?"

I had watched his face carefully, and I knew that, like the dark-faced
young man and Gill, the servant, he believed my brain unbalanced.

"I assure you, my dear sir, you entirely misunderstand me," he
protested.  "I merely say--"

"Oh, enough!"  I cried angrily, turning upon my heel and leaving the
room abruptly.  I was sick of the chattering old idiot, who evidently
believed that I was not responsible for my actions.

Down the wide oak stairs I passed, and in the great hall, which seemed
to run the whole length of the house, and was filled with stands of
armour, tattered banners, and trophies of the chase, I encountered the
pale-faced man who had sent for old Britten.

I was passing him by, intent upon exploring this strange house in which
I found myself, when, approaching me, he said--

"Would you please come into the library for one moment?"

"The library?"  I asked, looking at him, puzzled.  "Where is it?"

He opened a door close by, and I followed him into a comfortable study,
lined with books from floor to ceiling.  In the centre was a large
writing-table littered with papers, while close beside was another
smaller table, very severe and business-like.

"Well?"  I inquired.  "What do you want?"

"This telegram has just arrived," he answered excitedly, unlocking a
drawer in the smaller writing-table, and taking out a telegram, which he
handed to me.

Puzzled, I took the flimsy paper and read the words written thereon, as
follows:--

"We are to-day in receipt of following telegram from our Vancouver
branch--`Inform Wilford Heaton that Charles Mawson, Dawson City, has
struck it seven dollars to pan.'  Bank of British North America,
London."

Such a message was utterly unintelligible to me.

"Well?"  I inquired, raising my eyes and looking at him, surprised.  "I
don't see why this Charles Mawson, whoever he is, need hasten to tell me
that.  What does it matter to me?"

"Matter?  My dear sir?  Matter?" he cried, staring at me, as though in
wonder.  "There must, I think, be something the matter with you."

"Well, perhaps you'll kindly explain what it means?"  I said, "I have, I
assure you, no idea."

"Why, it means," he said, his face betraying his intense excitement--"it
means that Woodford's report is correct, that there is, after all, rich
gold on the concession; in short, that, being owner of one of the most
valuable placer concessions, you are a millionaire!"

"That's all very interesting," I remarked with a smile, while he stood
staring at me in abject wonder.

"I fear," he said, "that you're not quite yourself to-day.  The injury
to your head has possibly affected you."

"No, it hasn't," I snapped quickly.  "I'm quite as clear-headed as you
are."

"Then I should have thought that to any man in his sane senses such a
telegram as that would have been extremely gratifying," he observed.

"Now, tell me," I said; "do you know who I am?"

"I think I do.  You are Mr Wilford Heaton."

"And you tell me that I'm a millionaire?"

"I do, most certainly."

"Then, much as I regret to be compelled to say it, young man," I
answered, "I am of opinion that you're a confounded liar."

"But Mawson has struck the gold seven dollars to the pan," he pointed
out in protest.

"Well, what in the name of Fortune has it to do with me if he's struck
it a thousand dollars to the handful?"  I cried.

"I should be inclined to say it had a great deal to do with you as
holder of the concession," he answered quite coolly.

"Oh, bother the concession," I said hastily.  "I don't understand
anything whatever about it, and, what's more, I don't want to be worried
over any mining swindles."  Then I added, sinking into the padded chair
before the writing-table.  "You seem to know all about me.  Tell me,
now--what's your name?"

"My name?" he echoed, staring at me blankly, as though utterly puzzled.
"Well, I thought you knew it long ago.  I'm Gedge--Reginald Gedge."

"And what are you, pray?"

"I'm your secretary."

"My secretary!"  I echoed, gasping in amazement.  Then I added, "Look
here, you're trying to mislead me, all of you.  I have no secretary--
I've never had one.  All this chatter about mines and concessions and
such things is pure and simple rubbish."

"Very well," he answered with a slight sigh.  "If you would have it so
it must be.  Britten has already said that you are somewhat confused
after your accident."

"Britten be hanged!"  I roared.  "I'm no more confused than you are.
All I want is a straightforward explanation of how I came here, in this
house."

He smiled, pityingly I thought.  That old medical idiot had apparently
hinted to both the servant and this young prig, who declared himself my
secretary, that I was not responsible for my actions; therefore, what
could I expect?

"The explanation is one which I regret I cannot give you," he answered.
"All I want is your instructions what to wire to Mawson."

"Oh, bother Mawson!"  I cried angrily.  "Wire him whatever you like,
only don't mention his name again to me.  I don't know him, and don't
desire to make any acquaintance either with him or his confounded pans."

"I shall send him congratulations, and tell him to remain in Dawson City
pending further instructions."

"He can remain there until the Day of Judgment, for all I care," I said,
a remark which brought a smile to his pale features.

A brief silence fell between us.  All this was absolutely bewildering.
I had been struck down on the previous night in a street at Chelsea, to
find myself next day in a country house, and to be coolly informed by a
man who called himself my secretary that I was owner of a great gold
concession and a millionaire.  The whole thing seemed too utterly
incredible.

I felt my head, and found it bandaged.  There was no mistake about the
reality of it all.  It was no curious chimera of the imagination.

Before me upon the blotting-pad were some sheets of blank notepaper.  I
turned them over in idle curiosity, and found embossed upon them the
address in bold, black characters: "Denbury Court, near
Budleigh-Salterton."

"Is this place Denbury Court?"  I inquired.

"Yes."

"And whose guest am I, pray?"

"You are no one's guest.  This is your own house," was his amazing
response.

I turned towards him determinedly, and in a hard voice said--

"I think, Mr Gedge, that you've taken leave of your senses.  I've never
heard of this place before, and am certainly not its owner.  Are you
certain you are not confounding me with some one else--some one
resembling me in personal appearance?"

"Absolutely certain," he replied.  "Your name is Wilford Heaton, and I
repeat that I am your confidential private secretary."

I shook my head.

"Well," he said quickly, "here is some further proof," and bending
beside me he opened one of the drawers of the big writing-table, and
took therefrom a number of blank memorandum forms, which he placed
before me.  In eagerness I read their printed heading.  It was "From
Wilford Heaton, 103A, Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, E.C."

"Well, what are those used for?"  I asked in wonder.  "They are used at
the City office," he answered, tossing them back into the drawer.

"And you tell me I am wealthy?"  I said, with a cynical laugh.

"Your banker's pass-book should be sufficient proof of that," he
answered; and taking the book from an iron safe let into the opposite
wall, he opened it and placed it before me.

I glanced at the cover.  Yes, there was no mistake.  It was my own
pass-book.

My eyes fell upon the balance, standing to my credit, and the largeness
of the figures held me open-eyed in astonishment.

It was wealth beyond all my wildest dreams.

"And that is mine--absolutely mine?"  I inquired, when at last I found
tongue.

"Certainly," he replied, a moment later adding: "It is really very
strange that I have to instruct you in your own private affairs."

"Why have I an office in the City?"  I asked, for that point was
puzzling.

"In order to carry on your business."

"What business?"

"That of financial agent."

I smiled at the absurdity of the idea.  I had never been a thrifty man;
in fact, I had never had occasion to trouble my head about finance, and,
truth to tell, had always been, from a lad, a most arrant dunce at
figures.

"I fear I'm a sorry financier," I remarked for want of something better
to say.

"You are acknowledged to be one of the shrewdest and the soundest in the
City of London," Gedge answered.

"Well," I remarked, closing the pass-book, securing the flap, and
handing it back to him, "all I have to say is that this last hour that
has passed has been absolutely replete with mystery.  I can make nothing
of all these things you tell me--absolutely nothing.  I shall begin to
doubt whether I'm actually myself very soon."

"It would be better to rest a little, if I might advise," he said, in a
more deferential tone than before.  "Britten suggested repose.  That
blow has upset you a little.  To-morrow you'll be quite right again, I
feel sure."

"I don't intend to rest until I've cleared up this mystery," I said
determinedly, rising from the table.

At that moment, however, the door opened, and turning quickly, I was
confronted by an angular, bony-faced, lantern-jawed woman, whose rouged
and powdered face and juvenility of dress struck me as utterly
ludicrous.  She was fifty, if a day, and although her face was wrinkled
and brown where the artificial complexion had worn off, she was
nevertheless attired in a manner becoming a girl of twenty.

"Oh, my dear Wilford!  Whatever has happened?" she cried in alarm, in a
thin, unmusical voice, when she beheld the bandages around my head.

I looked at her in mingled surprise and amusement; she was so doll-like
and ridiculous in her painted juvenility.

"Mr Heaton accidentally struck his head against the statue in the
drawing-room, madam," explained Gedge.  "Doctor Britten has assured me
that the injury is not at all serious.  A little rest is all that is
necessary."

"My dear Wilford!  Oh, my dear Wilford!  Why didn't you call me at
once?"

"Well, madam," I answered, "that was scarcely possible, considering that
I had not the honour of your acquaintance."

"What!" she wailed.  "You--you can't really stand there and coolly tell
me that you don't know me?"

"I certainly assert, madam, that I have absolutely no knowledge whatever
of whom you may be," I said with some dignity.

"Is your brain so affected, then, that you actually fail to recognise
me--Mary, your wife!"

"You!"  I gasped, glaring at her, dumbfounded.  "You, my wife!
Impossible!"





MY UNKNOWN WIFE'S STORY.

"My dear Wilford!" exclaimed the thin-faced, angular woman.  "I really
think you must have taken leave of your senses."

"My dear madam," I cried excitedly, "I haven't the slightest notion of
your name.  To the best of my knowledge, I've never had the pleasure of
meeting you before this moment.  Yet you have the boldness to assert
that you are my wife!  The thing is absolutely preposterous!"  I laughed
cynically.

"You must be mad to talk like this!" the woman answered with some
asperity.

"I tell you that I'm not mad, madam," I protested, "and further, I
declare that I have never married."

"What rubbish you talk!" she said.  "This accident to your head has
evidently affected your intellect.  You must rest, as Doctor Britten has
ordered."

"The doddering old idiot thinks, like yourself, that I'm not quite
responsible for my actions," I laughed.  "Well, we shall see."

"If you were in your right senses you would never deny that I am your
wife," answered the overdressed woman.  "The thing's too absurd."

"My dear madam," I cried, growing angry, "your allegations are utterly
ridiculous, to say the least.  All this is either some confounded
conspiracy, or else you mistake me for somebody else.  I tell you that I
am Wilford Heaton, of Essex Street, Strand, a bachelor who has neither
thought nor inclination of marrying."

"And I tell you that you are Wilford Heaton, my husband, and owner of
this house," she answered, her face growing redder with excitement.

The situation was certainly stranger than any other in which a man could
possibly be placed.  That it was no dream, but a stern reality, was
entirely plain.  I glanced around the comfortable library, and saw there
evidences of wealth and refinement, while through the window beyond my
gaze fell upon the wide park sloping away to a large lake glistening in
the sunshine, and through the trees beyond could be seen a distant
glimpse of the blue waters of the English Channel.

I stood utterly nonplussed by the startling declaration of this
artificial-looking person, who aped youth so ridiculously, and yet spoke
with such an air of confidence and determination.

"And you actually expect me to believe this absurd story of yours, that
I am your husband, when only last night I dined at The Boltons, and was
then a bachelor?  Besides, madam," I added with a touch of sarcasm, for
I confess that my anger was now thoroughly aroused, "I think the--well,
the difference in our ages is sufficient to convince any one that--"

"No, no," she hastened to interrupt me, as though that point were very
distasteful to her.  "Age is entirely out of the question.  Am I to
understand that you distinctly deny having made me your wife?"

"I do, most decidedly," I laughed, for the very idea was really too
ridiculous to entertain.

She exchanged a pitying look with Gedge, who stood at a little distance,
watching in silence.

"Poor Wilford! poor Wilford?" she ejaculated in a tone of sympathy, and,
addressing the man who called himself my secretary, said, "It seems
quite true what the doctor has declared; the blow has upset the balance
of his mind."

"Madam," I cried very determinedly, "you will oblige me by not adding
further insult to your attempted imposture--for such sympathy is
insulting to me."

She clasped her hands, turned her eyes upwards, and sighed in the manner
of the elderly.

"You believe that I'm mad.  Therefore you are trying to impose upon me!"
I went on furiously.  "But I tell you, my dear madam, that I am just as
sane as yourself, and am fully prepared to prove that I am not your
husband."

"Ask Mr Gedge whether I speak the truth or not," she said, turning to
the secretary.

"Certainly," answered the man addressed, looking straight into my face.
"I have no hesitation whatever in bearing out Mrs Heaton's statement."

"It's all humbug!"  I cried, turning savagely upon him.  "I don't know
this woman from Adam!"

"Well," he laughed cynically, "you ought to know her pretty well, at any
rate."

It was apparent from his tone that he had no very high opinion of her.

"I'm pleased to say that until this present moment we have been
strangers," I said, for I was not in a humour to mince words.

"You are extremely complimentary, Wilford," she observed resentfully.

"It appears to me that compliments are entirely unnecessary in this
affair," I said.  "You are endeavouring to thrust yourself upon me as my
wife, in order, I suppose, to achieve some object you have in view.  But
I tell you once and for all, madam, that any such attempt will be
futile.  To speak plainly, I don't know you, neither have I any desire
to add you to my list of acquaintances."

"Well," she cried; "of all the stories I've ever heard, this is the most
extraordinary!"

"I think, madam, I may say the same," I remarked coldly.  "Your story is
the wildest and most incredible that I've ever heard.  Last night, as a
bachelor, I dined with friends in Kensington, and left at a late hour,
calling at a house in Chelsea on my way home to Essex Street.  To-day I
awake to be told that I am the owner of wealth beyond the dreams of
avarice; master of this house--in Devonshire, I believe, isn't it; and
your lawful husband.  Now, if you think me capable of swallowing such a
pack of palpable fictions as these, you must certainly consider me
absolutely insane, for none but a madman would give credence to such a
tissue of lies."

"Doctor Britten considers that your brain is unbalanced, because you do
not know the truth," she said calmly.  "I quite agree with him."

"He's a fool--a drivelling idiot," I cried, forgetting myself in the
heat of the moment, and using an unwriteable word.  Mention of that
pottering old fossil's name was to me as a red rag to a bull.  "I surely
know who and what I am!"  I cried.

"No, my dear Wilford, that's just it.  You don't know who you are," the
woman answered with a smile.

"Oh!"  I exclaimed.  "Then perhaps you'll kindly inform me.  All this
may be very amusing to you, but I assure you that to me it's the very
reverse."

"I can only tell you who you are as I know you to be," answered the
powdered-faced, doll-like old lady, whose attempts at juvenile coquetry
sickened me.

"Go on," I said, preparing myself for more attempts to befool me.

"I ask you first whether you are not Wilford Heaton, of Heaton Manor,
near Tewkesbury?"

"Certainly."

"And you were once stricken by blindness?"

"That is so, unfortunately."

"And you are now carrying on business as a financier in the City of
London?"

"I know nothing of finance," I answered.  "This Mr Gedge--or whatever
his name is--has told me some absurd fairy tale about my position in
London, but knowing myself, as I do, to be an arrant duffer at figures,
I'm quite positive that the story is all bunkum."

"Then how do you account for these memorandum forms?" inquired Gedge,
taking some from the table, "and for these letters?  Are they not in
your handwriting?"

I glanced at the letters he held.  They referred to some huge financial
transaction, and were certainly in a hand that appeared wonderfully like
my own.

"Some one has been imposing upon you, I tell you.  This is a case of
mistaken identity--it must be, my dear sir."

"But I tell you it isn't," protested Gedge.  "All that your wife has
said is the absolute truth."

"My wife!"  I cried angrily.  "I have no wife--thank Heaven!"

"No, no," whined the painted old woman, dabbing her eyes with her
handkerchief, very lightly, however, so as not to disturb their
artificiality.  "No, don't say that, my dear Wilfred, don't say that!
You know that you are my husband--you know you are!"

"I know, my dear madam, quite well that I do not occupy that
distinguished position," I responded very firmly.

"But I can prove it--I can prove it!" she cried, with a futile effort at
tears.

"Then I shall be most interested to see this extraordinary fiction
proved," I said.  "Perhaps we shall then get down to facts."

"The facts are as already stated," Gedge remarked.

"Then let me see proof.  There must be a certificate or official entry
somewhere if what this lady says is really correct.  Where is it?"

"My certificate was stolen when my jewel-case was rifled in the train
between Waterloo and Exeter," she answered.  "But, of course, a copy can
easily be obtained.  Your solicitor in London can get a copy at once
from Somerset House."

"Certificate stolen!"  I cried.  "A most ingenious excuse.  I quite
anticipated it, although it, unfortunately, exhibits no originality.
Thieves don't usually steal marriage certificates.  They can't pawn
them, you know."

The woman before me glanced around the room with an air of bewilderment,
and I then knew that I had cornered her.

"And where did this extraordinary marriage between us take place, pray?"
I inquired, not without some bitter irony.

"At St Andrew's, Wells Street."

"Wells Street, in London?"

"Yes.  You surely remember it, don't you?  The church is close by Oxford
Circus."

"I know the church quite well," I answered.  "But I most firmly and
distinctly deny ever having been inside it in my life."

"If you examine the marriage register there you'll find your signature,
together with that of your wife," Gedge observed, with a confidence that
rather surprised me.

"I shall certainly take no trouble in such a matter," I declared.  "It
is alleged that I am the husband of this lady, therefore it is for her
to bring proof--not for me to seek it."

"Very well, then," cried the woman who called herself Mrs Heaton.
"Within three days a copy of the certificate shall be placed in your
hands."

"I'm not very partial to copies of documents," I observed very
dubiously.  "I always prefer originals."

"The original is, unfortunately, lost."

"Stolen, or strayed away of its own accord--eh?"  I added with a
doubtful laugh.

"Are you content to wait until the certificate can be obtained from
Somerset House?" she inquired.

"No," I responded.  "If you are actually my wife as you allege, madam,
perhaps you will kindly explain the mystery of my presence here, in a
house that until an hour ago I had never seen in all my life."

The woman and the secretary again exchanged glances.  I saw they
considered me an utterly irresponsible agent.  They believed me to be
demented.

"None of us can explain it," Gedge answered.  "There is some mystery,
but what it is we can't yet fathom."

"Mystery!"  I echoed.  "I should think there was some mystery--and
devilishly complicated it must be too, when I find myself in this
amazing position.  Why, it's sufficient to turn the brain of any man to
be told of one's marriage to a--to a woman one has never set eyes upon
before, and--well, old enough to be his own mother!"

"Hush, hush!" said the secretary, who apparently wished to avoid a
scene.  He evidently knew that this angular woman, notwithstanding her
affected juvenility, possessed a fiendish temper.  I had detected it by
the keen look in her eyes and the twitchings of her thin, hard lips.

"If I'm in my own house," I cried wrathfully, "I am surely permitted to
say what I like.  Am I master here, or not?"

"Certainly you are, sir," he responded, instantly humbled.

"Then listen," I said.  "Until the arrival of the certificate from
London I have no wish to meet this lady who alleges that she is my
wife."

Then, turning to her, I made her a mock bow, adding, ironically--

"I think, madam, that it will avoid any further words of a disagreeable
nature if we remain apart for the present."

"Certainly, Wilford," she cried, putting her hands out to me with an
imploring gesture.  "Go and rest, there's a dear, and carry out Doctor
Britten's orders.  You will soon be right again if you do.  You've been
puzzling your head too much over your figures, and the blow has affected
you.  Go and rest.  But before you go I would ask you one favour."

"Well?"  I inquired in a hard voice.

She drew nearer to me, and with that detestable artificial coquetry
lifted her face to mine that I might kiss her.

"No!"  I cried roughly, for I was beside myself with anger.  "Let me
remain in peace.  I don't want to meet you again, my dear madam, until--
until I know the worst."

"What have I done, Wilford, that you should treat me thus?" she wailed
bitterly, bursting into a torrent of tears.  "Oh, what have I done?
Tell me."

"I don't know what you've done, and I'm sure I'm not interested in it,"
I responded.  "All I know is that when you declare that you are my wife
you tell a deliberate and downright lie."

For a moment she stood in hesitation, then, with tears flowing fast, she
covered her face with her hands and staggered from the room.

Was she only acting the broken-hearted wife, or was that emotion real?
Which, I could not decide.

If all this were part of some conspiracy, it was certainly one of no
ordinary character.  But what a confounded old hag the woman was!  I
shuddered.  Surely she could not be my wife!  The suggestion was too
utterly preposterous to be entertained for a single moment, and within
myself I laughed her allegation to scorn.





HOW MANY YESTERDAYS?

"Now," I said, turning to Gedge, "perhaps you will show me over this new
domain of mine.  They seem to be pretty comfortable quarters, at any
rate."

He looked at me strangely.

"You surely don't mean, sir, that you wish me to show you over your own
house?" he said with incredulity.

"Of course I do," I answered.  "I've never been over it yet, and I think
I may as well embrace the opportunity now."

"But hadn't you better go to your room and rest?  It will surely do you
good.  I'll ring for Rayner, the valet."  He spoke as though solicitous
of my welfare.

"I want no valets, neither do I require rest," I answered impatiently.
"I mean to fathom this mystery."

"But pardon me," he said deferentially, "there is no mystery, as far as
I can see.  You accidentally struck your head against the statue while
passing through the drawing-room, and were rendered unconscious.  The
blow has, according to the doctor, impaired your mental capacity a
little.  In a few days you'll be all right again.  Poor Mrs Heaton!--
she's awfully upset."

"I will not have her called Mrs Heaton!"  I cried in indignation.
"Understand that!  I have no wife--and a hag like that I certainly would
never marry."  He raised his eyebrows with a gesture of regret, sighed,
but hazarded no remark.

"Come," I said, "show me over the place.  It will be a most interesting
visit, I'm sure."  And I laughed, reflecting upon my extraordinary
position, one absolutely unparalleled in man's history.

"But before doing so will you not sign one or two cheques?" he urged,
glancing at his watch.  "The postman will call for the letters in half
an hour, and they must be dispatched to-day."

"What cheques?"

"There are six," he answered, taking out a large cheque-book and opening
it.  "I've already made them out, if you will kindly sign them."

I glanced at them.  All six were for large amounts, each considerably
over a thousand pounds.

"They relate to business transactions, all of which are exceedingly good
bargains," he explained.

"Well," I said, laughing again.  "I've never before signed cheques for
such big amounts as these.  But here goes, if you wish.  Whether they'll
be honoured is quite another thing."

And I took up a pen and appended my signature to each, while he placed
one by one in envelopes ready directed to receive them.

"Now," he said at last, "if you really wish me to take you round I'll do
so, but the whole thing seems so droll and absurd that I hope, sir,
you'll excuse my doubts as to your sanity."

"Well, why do you think I'm insane?"  I asked, looking straight at him.
"Do I look like a madman?"

"Not at all.  With your head swathed in those bandages, you look like a
man who's received a serious injury."

"Of course, that confounded old charlatan Britten put forward the
suggestion that I'm not in my right mind!"  I said.  "But I tell you
quite calmly, and without fear of contradiction--indeed, I could swear
upon oath--that never in my life have I entered this place or set eyes
upon you or upon that painted old girl before to-day.  Now, if you were
in my place, surely you would resent, being called husband by a woman
whom you don't know from Adam; you wouldn't relish being condemned as a
lunatic by an idiotic old country quack, and being imposed upon all
round by persons in whom you have not the slightest interest."

His face relaxed into a smile.

"If I may be permitted to advise," he said, "I think it best not to
discuss the matter further at present.  A solution must present itself
before long.  Meanwhile your intellect will be rendered the clearer by
repose."

"I've already told you that I don't intend to rest until I've extricated
myself from this absurdly false position," I said determinedly.  "I feel
absolutely certain that I've been mistaken for some one of the same
name."

He shrugged his shoulders.  He was evidently a shrewd fellow, this man
who said he was my secretary, and was apparently a very confidential
servant.

"I'd like to know what to reply to Mawson's cable," he said.  "You
really ought to take some notice of such a marvellous stroke of good
fortune.  His discovery means fabulous wealth for you as holder of the
concession."

"My dear sir," I said, "for mercy's sake don't bother me about this
fellow and his confounded pans.  Reply just as you like.  You seem to
know all about it.  I don't--nor do I want to know."

"But in a case like this I do not care to act on my own discretion
alone," he protested.  "They are evidently awaiting a reply in Dawson
City."

"Let them wait," I said.  "I don't want to bother my head over matters
in which I can have no possible concern.  This alleged matrimonial
alliance of mine is of far more importance to me than all the gold in
the Klondyke."

"Well, the lady is your wife, so why worry further about it?" he said.

"And how do you know, pray?"

"Because I was present at the ceremony."

I looked at him for a moment, unable to utter further words.

"I suppose you'll tell me next that you were my secretary in my bachelor
days?"  I said at last.

"Certainly I was."

"And you say that you were actually present at the church, and saw me
married?"  I cried, absolutely incredulous.

"I was.  You were married at St Andrew's, Wells Street.  It was a smart
wedding, too, for Mrs Fordyce was very well known in society, and had a
large circle of friends."

"Fordyce?"  I echoed, puzzled.

"Yes, that was Mrs Heaton's name before her marriage with you."

"Then she was a widow?"  I gasped.

He nodded in the affirmative.

I groaned.  The affair grew more puzzling now that he declared himself
an actual witness of my matrimonial misfortune.

But how could such a thing have taken place without my knowledge?  It
was impossible.  The mystery, like the strange incidents which had
preceded this remarkable situation in which I found myself, grew more
and more inexplicable each hour.

We went forth, together, passing from room to room through the great
country mansion.  The place was handsome, of rather modern type,
furnished glaringly in the manner which bespoke the parvenu.  It
possessed no mellow, time-worn appearance, as did the dear old Manor
House beside the Severn.  The furniture and hangings were too apparently
of the Tottenham Court Road type, and the art displayed was that of the
art furnisher given _carte blanche_ to furnish with the newest and most
fashionable fancies in the matter of wallpapers, dadoes, cornices, and
art-pottery.  There were art-carpets and art-curtains, art-cupboards and
art-chairs, art-china and art-chintzes.  Art was everywhere in painful
enamel and impossible greens.  There were pictures, too, but different,
indeed, to the long row of noble faces with their ruffles and doublets
and their arms painted on shields in the corners that looked down so
solemnly in the great hall at Heaton.  The pictures in that modern
mansion were of the _queue-de-siecle_ French school, daubs by the
miscalled impressionists, some being rather too _chic_ to be decent.

That a large amount of money had been expended upon the place I could
not doubt, but the effect was that of dazzling the gaze by colour, and
nowhere seemed there a good, comfortable old-fashioned sitting-room.
All the apartments were arranged to please the eye, and not for personal
comfort.  The house was just the kind that a man suddenly successful in
the city might set up in the vain endeavour to develop into a country
gentleman; for to become such is the ideal of every silk-hatted business
man, whether he trades in stocks or stockings.

"That I should be compelled to show you over your own house is, to say
the least, very amusing," said Gedge, as we were passing up the grand
staircase.  "If people were told of this they wouldn't believe it
possible."

"I myself don't believe what you tell me is possible," I remarked.  "But
who gave orders for this furniture?"

"You did."

"And who chose it--approved of the designs, and all that sort of thing?"

"You certainly did," he answered.  "Some of the ideas were, of course,
Mrs Heaton's."

"I thought so.  I don't believe myself capable of such barbaric taste as
those awful blues and greens in the little sitting-room."

"The morning-room you mean."

"I suppose so.  The whole place is like a furniture show-room--this
style complete, thirty-five guineas, and so on.  You know the sort of
thing I mean."

He smiled in amusement at my words.

"Your friends all admire the place," he remarked.

"What friends?"

"Sir Charles Stimmel, Mr Larcombe, Lady Fraser, and people of that
class."

"I never heard of them in all my life.  Who are they?"  I inquired,
interested.

"Friends of yours.  They visit here often enough.  You surely ought to
know them.  Lady Fraser is your wife's dearest friend."

"Fraser?"  I said reflectively.  "The only Fraser I know is a baker in
Clare Market, who supplies my old servant, Mrs Parker, with bread."
Then, after a pause, I added, "And you say that these people are friends
of mine?  Have I many friends?"

"Lots.  A rich man has always plenty of good-humoured acquaintances."

"They like to come down here for a breath of country air, I suppose,
eh?"  I laughed.

"That's about it," he answered.  "A good many of them are not very
sincere in their friendship, I fear.  The man who has money, lives well,
keeps a good table, and has choice wines in his cellar need never be at
a loss for genial companions."

"You seem to be a bit of a philosopher, my friend."  I remarked.

He smiled knowingly.

"I haven't acted as your secretary without learning a few of the crooked
ways of the world."

"What?"  I exclaimed.  "Don't I always act honestly, then?"  This was
something entirely new.

"Nobody can be honest in finance."

"Well," I said, resenting his imputation, "I wasn't aware that I had
ever swindled a person of sixpence in my life."

"Sixpences in such sums as they deal in at Winchester House don't count.
It's the thousands."

We passed a couple of gaping maid-servants in long-stringed caps, who
stood aside, looking at me in wonder.  No doubt the news that a demented
man was in the house had reached the servants' hall.  I was, in fact, on
show to the domestics.

"Then you mean to imply that these financial dealings of mine--of which,
by the way, I have no knowledge whatsoever--are not always quite
straight?"  I said, as we walked together down a long carpeted corridor.
He looked at me in hesitation.

"It's, of course, business," he answered--"sharp business.  I don't mean
to imply that the dealings at Winchester House are any more unfair than
those of any other financier in the City; but sometimes, you know,
there's just a flavour of smartness about them that might be
misconstrued by a clever counsel in a criminal court."

"What?"  I cried, halting and glaring at him.  "Now, be frank with me,
Gedge.  Tell me plainly, have I ever swindled anybody?"

"Certainly not," he said, laughing.  "Why, it's this very smartness that
has made you what you are to-day--a millionaire.  If you had not been
very wide awake and shrewd you'd have been ruined long ago."

"Then, I suppose, I'm well known in the city, eh?"

"Your name's as well known as Bennett's clock, and your credit stands as
high as any one's between Ludgate Hill and Fenchurch Street."

"Extraordinary!"  I said.  "What you tell me sounds like some remarkable
fairy tale."

"The balance at your banker's is sufficient proof that what I say is
truth," he remarked.  "There may be a good many fairy tales in certain
prospectuses, but there certainly is none in your financial soundness."

We wandered on from room to room.  There must, I think, have been quite
thirty sleeping apartments, guests' rooms, etc, all furnished in that
same glaring style, that greenery-yellow abomination miscalled art.

"The next room," explained my secretary, as we approached the end of the
corridor, "is Mrs Heaton's boudoir.  I expect she's in there.  I saw
Dalton, her maid, enter a moment ago."

"Oh, for Heaven's sake, leave her alone!"  I said, turning at once on my
heel.  I had no wish to meet that awful rejuvenated hag again.

I fancy Gedge smiled, but if he did he was very careful to hide his
amusement from me.  He was, without doubt, a very well-trained
secretary.

The thought of Mabel Anson crossed my mind.  All the recollections of
the dinner on the previous night, and the startling discoveries I
subsequently made recurred to me at that moment, and I felt dazed and
bewildered.  This painted and powdered person could surely not be my
wife, when I loved Mabel Anson with all my soul!  Only yesterday I had
sat at her side at dinner, and had felt the pressure of her soft,
delicate hand upon mine.  No; it could not be that I was actually
married.  Such a thing was utterly impossible, for surely no man could
go through the marriage ceremony without knowing something about it.

Hickman's treachery angered me.  Why, I wondered, had he enticed me to
his rooms in order to make that extraordinary attempt upon my life?  The
wound upon my head was undoubtedly due to the blow he had dealt me.  The
theory that I had accidentally knocked my head against the marble statue
and broken it was, I felt assured, only one of that fool Britten's
brilliant ideas with which he misled his too-confiding patients.  If
this were so, then all the incidents subsequent to my recovery of
consciousness were part of the conspiracy which had commenced on the
previous night with Hickman's attempt.

We descended the stairs, passing the footman Gill, who with a bow,
said--

"I hope, sir, you feel better."

"A little," I answered.  "Bring me a whisky and soda to the library."

And the man at once disappeared to do my bidding.  "I suppose he think's
I'm mad," I remarked.  "This is a very remarkable _menage_, to say the
least."

In the great hall, as I walked towards the library, was a long mirror,
and in passing I caught sight of my own figure in it.  I stopped, and
with a loud cry of wonder and dismay stood before it, glaring at my own
reflection.

The bandages about my head gave me a terribly invalid appearance, but
reflected by that glass I saw a sight which struck me dumb with
amazement.  I could not believe my eyes; the thing staggered belief.

On the morning before I had shaved as usual, but the glass showed that I
now wore a well cut, nicely reddish-brown beard!

My face seemed to have changed curiously.  I presented an older
appearance than on the day before.  My hair seemed to have lost its
youthful lustre, and upon my brow were three distinct lines--the lines
of care.

I felt my beard with eager hands.  Yes, there was no mistake.  It was
there, but how it had grown was inconceivable.

Beyond, through the open door, I saw the brilliant sunlight, the green
lawn, the bright flowers and cool foliage of the rustling trees.

It was summer.  Yet only yesterday was chill, dark winter, with
threatening snow.

Had I been asleep like Rip Van Winkle in the legend?  "Tell me," I cried
excitedly, turning to the man standing behind me, "what's the day of the
month to-day?"

"The seventeenth of July."

"July?"  I echoed.  "And what year is this?"

"Why, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, of course."

"Ninety-six!"  I gasped, standing glaring at him in blank amazement.
"Ninety-six?"

"Certainly.  Why?"

"Am I really losing my senses?"  I cried, dismayed.  "_Yesterday was six
years ago_!"





GEDGE TELLS THE TRUTH.

"Yesterday six years ago!" he echoed, looking at me in blank
bewilderment.  "What do you mean?"

"I mean that if what you've told me is really the truth," I cried, agape
in wonder, "then it is the most astounding thing I've ever heard of.
Are you absolutely certain of the date?"

"Certain?  Why, of course."

"Of the year, I mean?"

"Positive.  It's eighteen ninety-six."

"For how long, then, have you been my secretary?"  I inquired.

"Nearly five years."

"And how long have I lived in this place?"

"For nearly four."

"And that woman," I demanded, breathlessly--"is she actually my wife?"

"Most certainly," he answered.

I stood stupefied, stunned by this amazing statement.

"But," I protested, lost in wonder, "yesterday was years ago.  How do
you account for that?  Are you certain that you're not deceiving me?"

"I've told you the absolute truth," he responded.  "On that I stake my
honour."

I stood aghast, glaring at my reflection in the mirror, open-mouthed, as
though I gazed upon some object supernatural.  My personal appearance
had certainly changed, and that in itself convinced me that there must
be some truth in this man Gedge's statement.  I was older, a trifle
stouter than before, I think, and my red-brown beard seemed to give my
face a remarkably grotesque appearance.  I had always hated beards, and
considered them a relic of prehistoric barbarity.  It was surprising
that I should now have grown one.

"Then according to your account I must have spent yesterday here--
actually in this house?"

"Why, of course you did," he responded.  "We were engaged the greater
part of the day over Laffan's affair.  Walter Halliburton, the mining
engineer, came down to see you, and we were together all the afternoon.
He left for London at five."

"And where did I dine?"

"Here.  With Mrs Heaton."

"Don't speak of her as Mrs Heaton!"  I cried in anger.  "She's not my
wife, and I will not have her regarded as such."

He gave his shoulders a slight shrug.

"Now, look here, Mr Gedge," I said, speaking for the first time with
confidence.  "If you were in my place, awakening suddenly to find that
six years of your life had vanished in a single night, and that you were
an entirely different person to that of twelve hours ago, what would you
believe?"

He looked at me with a somewhat sympathetic expression upon his thin
features.

"Well, I don't know what I should think."  Then he added, "But surely
such a thing can't be possible."

"It is possible," I cried.  "It has happened to me.  I tell you that
last night was six years ago."

He turned from me, as though he considered further argument unavailing.

My head reeled.  What he had told me was utterly incredible.  It seemed
absolutely impossible that six whole years should have passed without my
knowledge; that I should have entered upon a business of which I had
previously known nothing; that I should have rapidly amassed a fortune;
and, most of all, that I should have married that powdered and painted
woman who had presented herself as my wife.  Yet such were the
unaccountable facts which this man Gedge asked me to believe.

He saw that I was extremely dubious about the date, therefore he led me
back to the library, where there hung upon the wall a large calendar,
which quickly convinced me.

Six; years had really elapsed since yesterday.

In that vexing and perplexing present I reflected upon the puzzling
past.  That happy dinner with Mabel at the Boltons, the subsequent
discoveries in that drawing-room where she had sat at the piano calmly
playing; her soft words of tenderness, and the subsequent treachery of
that dog-faced man Hickman, all passed before me with extraordinary
vividness.  Yet, in truth, all had happened long ago.

Alas!  I was not like other men.  To the practical, level-headed man of
affairs "To-day" may be sufficient, all-engrossing; but to the very
large majority--a majority which, I believe, includes also many of the
practical, the business of to-day admits of constant pleasant excursions
into the golden mists of "long ago," and many happy flights to the rosy
heights of "some day."  Most of those who read this strange story of my
life will remember with a melancholy affection, with a pain that is more
soothing than many pleasures, the house wherein they were born, or at
any rate the abode in which they passed the earlier years of their
lives.  The agonising griefs of childhood, the disappointments, the
soul-racking terrors, mellowed by the gentle touch of passing years,
have no sting for our mature sensibilities, but come back to us now with
a pathos that is largely tinctured with amusement.

I stood there reviewing the past, puzzled, utterly unable to account for
it.  Age, the iconoclast, had shattered most of the airy idols which my
youth had set up in honour of itself.  I had lost six of the most
precious years of my life--years that I had not lived.

Yet this man before me declared most distinctly that I had lived them;
that I had enjoyed a second existence quite apart and distinct from my
own self.  Incredible though it seemed, yet it became gradually
impressed upon me that what this man Gedge had told me was the actual,
hideous truth, and that I had really lived and moved and prospered
throughout those six unknown years, while my senses had at the same time
remained dormant, and I had thus been utterly unconscious of existence.

But could such a thing be?  As a prosaic man of the world I argued, as
any one in his right mind would argue, that such a thing was beyond the
bounds of possibility.  Nevertheless, be it how it might, the undisputed
fact remained that I had lapsed into unconsciousness on that winter's
night six years before, and had known absolutely nothing of my
surroundings until I found myself lying upon the floor of the
drawing-room of what was alleged to be my country house.

Six years out of a man's life is a large slice.  The face of the world
changes considerably in that space of time.  I found myself living a
life which was so artificial and incongruous to my own tastes as to
appear utterly unreal.  Yet, as I made further inquiry of this man
Gedge, every moment that passed showed me plainly that what he had said
was the truth.

He related to me the routine of my daily life, and I stood listening
agape in wonder.  He told me things of which I had no knowledge; of my
own private affairs, and of my business profits; he took big
leather-bound ledgers from the great green-painted safe, and showed me
formidable sums entered therein, relating, he explained, to the
transactions at the office up in London.  Some documents he showed me,
large official-looking sheets with stamps and seals and signatures,
which he said were concessions obtained from a certain foreign
Government, and opened my private letter-book, exhibiting letters I had
actually written with my own hand, but without having any knowledge of
having done so.

These revelations took away my breath.

It could not be mere loss of memory from which I was suffering.  I had
actually lived a second and entirely different life to that I had once
led in Essex Street.  Apparently I had become a changed man, had entered
business, had amassed a fortune--and had married.

Assuredly, I reflected, I could never have been in my right senses to
have married that angular person with the powdered cheeks.  That action,
in itself, was sufficient to convince me that my brain had been
unbalanced during those six lost years.

Alone, I stood, without a single sympathiser--without a friend.

How this astounding gap in my life had been produced was absolutely
beyond explanation.  I tried to account for it, but the reader will
readily understand that the problem was, to me, utterly inexplicable.
I, the victim of the treachery of that man Hickman, had fallen
unconscious one night, and had awakened to discover that six whole years
had elapsed, and that I had developed into an entirely different person.
It was unaccountable, nay, incredible.

I think I should have grown confidential towards Gedge were it not that
he apparently treated me as one whose mind was wandering.  He believed,
and perhaps justly so, that my brain had been injured by the accidental
blow.  To him, of course, it seemed impossible that I, his master,
should know nothing of my own affairs.  The ludicrousness of the
situation was to me entirely apparent, yet what could I do to avert it?

By careful questions I endeavoured to obtain from him some facts
regarding my past.

"You told me," I said, "that I have many friends.  Among them are there
any persons named Anson?"

"Anson?" he repeated reflectively.  "No, I've never heard the name."

"Or Hickman?"

He shook his head.

"I lived once in Essex Street, Strand," I said.  "Have I been to those
chambers during the time--the five years you have been in my service?"

Never, to my knowledge.

"Have I ever visited a house in The Boltons, at Kensington?"

"I think not," he responded.

"Curious!  Very curious!"  I observed, thinking deeply of the graceful,
dark-eyed Mabel whom I had loved six years before, and who was now lost
to me for ever.

"Among my friends is there a man named Doyle?"  I inquired, after a
pause.

"Doyle?  Do you mean Mr Richard Doyle, the war correspondent?"

"Certainly," I cried excitedly.  "Is he back?"

"He is one of your friends, and has often visited here," Gedge replied.

"What is his address?  I'll wire to him at once."

"He's in Egypt.  He left London last March, and has not yet returned."

I drew a long breath.  Dick had evidently recovered from fever in India,
and was still my best friend, although I had had no knowledge of it.

What, I wondered, had been my actions in those six years of
unconsciousness?  Mine were indeed strange thoughts at that moment.  Of
all that had been told me I was unable to account for anything.  I stood
stunned, confounded, petrified.

For knowledge of what had transpired during those intervening years, or
of my own career and actions during that period, I had to rely upon the
statements of others.  My mind during all that time had, it appeared,
been a perfect blank, incapable of receiving any impression whatsoever.

Nevertheless, when I came to consider how I had in so marvellous a
manner established a reputation in the City, and had amassed the sum now
lying at my bankers, I reflected that I could not have accomplished that
without the exercise of considerable tact and mental capacity.  I must,
after all, have retained shrewd senses, but they had evidently been
those of my other self--the self who had lived and moved as husband of
that woman who called herself Mrs Heaton.

"Tell me," I said, addressing Gedge again, "has my married life been a
happy one?"

He looked at me inquiringly.

"Tell me the truth," I urged.  "Don't conceal anything from me, for I
intend to get at the bottom of this mystery."

"Well," he said, with considerable hesitation, "scarcely what one might
call happy, I think."

"Ah, I understand," I said.  "I know from your tone that you sympathise
with me, Gedge."

He nodded without replying.  Strange that I had never known this man
until an hour ago, and yet I had grown so confidential with him.  He
seemed to be the only person who could present to me the plain truth.

Those six lost years were utterly puzzling.  I was as one returned from
the grave to find his world vanished, and all things changed.

I tried to reflect, to see some ray of light through the darkness of
that lost period, but to me it seemed utterly non-existent.  Those
years, if I had really lived them, had melted away and left not a trace
behind.  The events of my life prior to that eventful night when I had
dined at The Boltons had no affinity to those of the present.  I had
ceased to be my old self, and by some inexplicable transition,
mysterious and unheard of, I had, while retaining my name, become an
entirely different man.

Six precious years of golden youth had vanished in a single night.  All
my ideals, all my love, all my hope, nay, my very personality, had been
swept away and effaced for ever.

"Have I often visited Heaton--my own place?"  I inquired, turning
suddenly to Gedge.

"Not since your marriage, I believe," he answered.  "You have always
entertained some curious dislike towards the place.  I went up there
once to transact some business with your agent, and thought it a nice,
charming old house."

"Ay, and so it is," I sighed, remembering the youthful days I had spent
there long ago.  All the year round was sunshine then, with the most
ravishing snow-drifts in winter, and ice that sparkled in the sun so
brilliantly that it seemed almost as jolly and frolicsome as the
sunniest of sunlit streams, dancing and shimmering over the pebbles all
through the cloudless summer.  Did it ever rain in those old days long
ago?  Why, yes; and what splendid times I used to have on those
occasions--toffee-making in the schoolroom, or watching old Dixon, the
gamekeeper, cutting gun-wads in the harness-room.

And I had entertained a marked dislike to the place!  All my tastes and
ideas during those blank years had apparently become inverted.  I had
lived and enjoyed a world exactly opposite to my own--the world of
sordid money-making and the glaring display of riches.  I had, in a
word, aped the gentleman.

There was a small circular mirror in the library, and before it I stood,
marking every line upon my face, the incredible impress of forgotten
years.

"It is amazing, incredible!"  I cried, heart-sick with desire to
penetrate the veil of mystery that enshrouded that long period of
unconsciousness.  "All that you have told me, Gedge, is absolutely
beyond belief.  There must be some mistake.  It is impossible that six
years can have passed without my knowledge."

"I think," he said, "that, after all, Britten's advice should be
followed.  You are evidently not yourself to-day, and rest will probably
restore your mental power to its proper calibre."

"Bah!"  I shouted angrily.  "You still believe I'm mad.  I tell you I'm
not.  I'll prove to you that I'm not."

"Well," he remarked, quite calmly, "no sane man could be utterly
ignorant of his own life.  It doesn't stand to reason that he could."

"I tell you I'm quite as sane as you are," I cried.  "Yet I've been
utterly unconscious these six whole years."

"Nobody will believe you."

"But I swear it to be true," I protested.  "Since the moment when
consciousness left me in that house in Chelsea I have been as one dead."

He laughed incredulously.  The slightly confidential tone in which I had
spoken had apparently induced him to treat me with indifference.  This
aroused my wrath.  I was in no mood to argue whether or not I was
responsible for my actions.

"A man surely can't be unconscious, while at the same time he transacts
business and lives as gaily as you live," he laughed.

"Then you impute that all I've said is untrue, and is due merely to the
fact that I'm a trifle demented, eh?"

"Britten has said that you are suffering from a fit of temporary
derangement, and that you will recover after perfect rest."

"Then, by taking me around this house, showing me those books, and
explaining all to me, you've merely been humouring me as you would a
harmless lunatic!"  I cried furiously.  "You don't believe what I say,
that I'm perfectly in my right mind, therefore leave me.  I have no
further use for your presence, and prefer to be alone," I added harshly.

"Very well," he answered, rather piqued; "if you wish I'll, of course,
go."

"Yes, go; and don't return till I send for you.  Understand that!  I'm
in no humour to be fooled, or told that I'm a lunatic."

He shrugged his shoulders, and muttering some words I did not catch,
turned and left the library.





BROKEN THREADS.

He is a faint-hearted creature indeed who, while struggling along some
dark lane of life, cannot, at least intermittently, extract some comfort
to himself from the thought that the turn must come at last--the turn
which, presumably, will bring him out upon the well-metalled high-road
of happy contentment.

I do not know that I was exactly faint-hearted.  The mystery of it all
had so stunned me that I felt myself utterly incapable of believing
anything.  The whole thing seemed shadowy and unreal.

And yet the facts remained that I was alive, standing there in that
comfortable room, in possession of all my faculties, both mental and
physical, an entirely different person to my old self, with six years of
my past lost and unaccountable.

Beyond the lawn the shadow of the great trees looked cool and inviting,
therefore I went forth, wandering heedlessly across the spacious park,
my mind full of thoughts of that fateful night when I had fallen among
that strange company, and of Mabel, the woman I had loved so fondly and
devotedly.

Sweet were the recollections that came back to me.  How charming she had
seemed to me as we had lingered hand-in-hand on our walks across the
Park and Kensington Gardens, how soft and musical her voice! how full of
tenderness her bright dark eyes!  How idyllic was our love!  She had
surely read my undeclared passion.  She had known the great secret in my
heart.

Nevertheless, all had changed.  In a woman's life half a dozen years is
a long time, for she may develop from girl to matron in that space.  The
worst aspect of the affair presented itself to me.  I had, in all
probability, left her without uttering a word of farewell, and she--on
her part--had, no doubt, accepted some other suitor.  What more natural,
indeed, than she should have married?

That thought held me rigid.

Again, as I strolled on beneath the rustling elms which led straight
away in a wide old avenue towards where a distant village church stood,
a prominent figure in the landscape, there recurred to me vivid
recollections of that last night of my old self--of the astounding
discovery I had made in the drawing-room at The Boltons.

How was I to account for that?

I paused and glanced around upon the view.  All was quiet and peaceful
there in the mid-day sunlight.  Behind me stood the great white facade
of Denbury; before, a little to the right, lay a small village with its
white cottages--the villages of Littleham, I afterwards discovered--and
to the left white cliffs and the blue stretch of the English Channel
gleaming through the greenery.

From the avenue I turned and wandered down a by-path to a stile, and
there I rested, in full uninterrupted view of the open sea.  Deep below
was a cove--Littleham Cove, it proved to be--and there, under shelter of
the cliffs, a couple of yachts were riding gaily at anchor, while far
away upon the clear horizon a dark smoke-trail showed the track of a
steamer outward bound.

The day was brilliant.  It was July in Devonshire, that fairest of all
counties--and July there is always a superb month.  The air, warm and
balmy, was laden with the scent of roses and honeysuckle, the only
sounds that broke the quiet were the songs of the birds and the soft
rustling of the trees.

I sat there trying to decide how to act.

For the first time it occurred to me that my position was one of a
certain peril, for if I did not act with tact and caution, that woman
who called herself my wife, aided by that idiot Britten, might declare
that I was mad, and cause me to be placed beneath restraint.  Therefore,
to gain my freedom, it was evidently necessary that I should act with
discretion and keep my own counsel.

I looked around upon the fair panorama of nature spread before me.  The
world was six years older than when I had known it.  What national
events had, I wondered, happened in that time?  Place yourself in my
position, and picture to yourself the feeling of bewilderment that
overcame me when I reflected upon what might or might not have
transpired.

There crept over me a longing to escape from that place, the habitation
of that awful woman with the powdered cheeks, and to return to London.
All my life and pleasure had been centred in the giant capital, and to
it I intended now to go back and seek, if possible, the broken thread of
my history, which might lead me to an elucidation of the marvellous
mystery.

The world around me, the calm blue sea, the cloudless sky, the green
grass-lands, the soft whispering of the foliage seemed so peaceful that
I could scarce believe that so much evil, so much of human malice, could
exist.  The tranquillity of my surroundings induced within me a quieter
frame of mind, and I set to planning carefully how I might escape and
return to London.

To endeavour to do so openly would, I saw, be to draw upon me the spies
of my hideous wife.  Was I not believed by all to be insane?  Then
certainly I should not be allowed to go at large without some one at my
side.

I wanted to be alone.  The presence of a second person entertaining
suspicions as to my sanity would seriously hamper me, and prevent me
prosecuting the inquiries I intended to institute regarding my past.
No.  To escape successfully I should be compelled to fly to London, and
once there alter my appearance and assume another name.  Search would
undoubtedly be made for me, but once in London I felt confident in being
able to foil any efforts of my wife's agents.

Therefore I sat upon the stile and calmly matured my plans.

The chiming of a clock, apparently in the turret upon my own stables at
Denbury, fell upon my ears.  It struck one.  Then the sharp ringing of a
bell--the luncheon-bell--followed.

Gedge had told me that the place was near Budleigh-Salterton.  Was it
near enough, I wondered, for me to walk there, and was there a station?
There might, I reflected, be a map in the library.  I would be compelled
to trace it out and seek my route, for I was absolutely ignorant of that
corner of Devonshire.

Yes, my best policy, I decided, was to return to the house, act as
indifferently as possible, and meanwhile complete my plans for escape.

I retraced my steps to the house by the path I had traversed, and upon
the lawn was met by the man Gill, who announced--

"The luncheon-bell has rung, sir.  I hope you feel a little better,
sir."

"Oh, much better," I answered airily, and with an effort at
self-possession followed him into the imitation old-oak dining-room,
which Gedge had shown me during our tour of the place.

The woman with the powdered cheeks was already seated at the head of the
table, erect and stately, with an expression of _hauteur_ which ill
became her.

"I hope you feel better after your walk," she said, as I seated myself.

"Oh, much better," I responded in a tone of irony.  "The pain has
practically passed."

"You should really rest," she said, in that squeaky, artificial tone
which so jarred upon my nerves.  "Do take the doctor's advice."

It was on the tip of my tongue to make a further unwriteable remark
regarding the doctor, but I managed to control myself and reply--

"Yes, I think after luncheon I shall lie down for a little time.  I
have, however, some pressing letters to write first."

"Let Gedge attend to your correspondence for to-day," she urged, with
that mock juvenility which rendered her so hideously ridiculous.

"No," I responded.  "I have, unfortunately, to attend to several
pressing matters personally.  Afterwards I will rest."

"Do, there's a dear," she said.

I bit my lip.  She nauseated me when she used that affectionate term.
The only woman I loved was Mabel Anson, but whether she were still
alive, or whether married, I knew not.  The very thought that I was
bound in matrimony to this woman sitting in the high-backed chair of
carved oak was disgusting.  I loathed her.

How I continued to eat the dishes Gill handed me I know not, nor do I
remember what conversation passed between my pseudo-wife and myself as
we sat there.  Many were the abrupt and painful silences which fell
between us.

She struck me as an ascetic, strong-minded woman, who, before others,
fawned upon me with an affected devotion which in one of her age was
ludicrous; yet when we were alone she was rigid and overbearing, with
the positive air of one who believed me far beneath her alike in social
station and in intellect.  When Gill was absent she spoke in a hard,
patronising tone, which so angered me that with great difficulty I
retained my temper.

Yet it was my policy, I knew, to conceal my thoughts, and to lead her to
believe that the words I had uttered, and my failure to recognise her,
were owing to the blow I accidentally received, and that I was now, just
as I had been before, her husband.

What a hollow sham that meal was!  Now that I think of it I cannot
refrain from smiling at my extraordinary position, and how I showed her
delicate attention in order to the more impress her of my solicitude for
her welfare.

When at last she rose it was with a hope that I would go to my room and
rest.

I seized that opportunity.

"I shall," I answered.  "But don't let them call me for dinner.  I will
have something when I awake.  Britten has ordered perfect quiet."

"Very well," she answered.  Then, turning to Gill, she said, "You hear.
Mr Heaton is not to be aroused at dinner."

"Yes, madam," answered the man, bowing as we both passed out.

At once I walked along to the library, shut the door, and locked it.

I had much to do to prepare for my flight.

Yes, as I had expected, there was an ordnance map of the Teignmouth
district tacked to the wall; and searching, I quickly found Denbury
marked upon it, standing on the Exmouth road over the High Land of
Orcombe, halfway between that place and Budleigh-Salterton.  The
South-Western Railway ran; I saw, from Exmouth to London, by way of
Exeter, and my first impulse was to walk into Exmouth, and take train
thence.  The fact that I was probably known at that station occurred to
me, therefore I made up my mind to avoid the terminus and join the train
at Lympston, a small station further towards Exeter.

Taking up my pen I made a rough sketch-plan of my route, which passed
Littleham church, then by the left-hand road struck across country,
crossing the high-road to Exmouth at right angles, continuing through
the village of Withycombe Raleigh, and keeping straight on until it
joined the main road to Exeter.  At the commencement of the village of
Lympston it was necessary, I saw, to turn sharp to the left, and at the
end of the road I should find the station, close to the river Exe.

In order to avoid mistaking the road and entering the town of Exmouth, I
made a full and careful plan, which when completed I placed in my
pocket.  The distance, I calculated roughly, was between five and six
miles over a road rather difficult to find without a map.

Among the books on the table I found a Bradshaw, with the page of local
trains turned down, and from it learned that a train with connexion from
London stopped at Lympston at 7:55 p.m., while the train in connexion
with the up-mail from Exeter stopped there at 8:20.  The latter I
decided upon taking.

The fact that I had expressed my desire to sleep would prevent Gill
coming to call me at the dinner hour, and by the time I was missed I
should be well on my way to London.

The question of money occurred to me.  I had noticed some loose gold and
a couple of five-pound notes in one of the drawers which Gedge had
opened, and having a duplicate set of keys in my pocket, I transferred
the whole--a little under fourteen pounds--to my pocket.

Then I took out my cheque-book.  It was too large to be carried in my
pocket, therefore I tore out a couple of dozen or so, folded them, and
placed them in an envelope.

I recognised that I could draw money with them, yet the bank need not
know my whereabouts.  If these people, who would, I suppose, call
themselves "my friends," made active search to find the fugitive
"madman," they would certainly obtain no clue from my bankers.

In the same drawer as the cheque-book I found a black leather portfolio,
securely locked.

The latter fact impressed me.  Everything else was open to my secretary,
who possessed keys, both to writing-table and safe.  But this was
locked, apparently because therein were contained certain private papers
that I had wished to keep from his eyes.

No man, whoever he may be, reposes absolute confidence in his secretary.
Every one has some personal matter, the existence of which he desires
to preserve secret to himself alone.

I drew forth the locked portfolio, and placed it upon the blotting-pad
before me.  It was an expansive wallet, of a kind such as I remembered
having seen carried by bankers' clerks in the City from bank to bank,
attached by chains to the belts around their waists.

Surely upon my ring I must possess a key to it.  I looked, and found a
small brass key.

It fitted, and a moment later I had unlocked the wallet and spread my
own private papers before me.

What secrets of my lost life, I wondered, might not those carefully
preserved letters and documents contain?

In eager, anxious wonder I turned them over.

Next instant a cry of dismay broke involuntarily from my lips, as within
trembling fingers I held one of those papers--a letter addressed to me.

I could scarce believe my own eyes as I read it.  Yet the truth was
plain--hideously plain.





I MAKE A DISCOVERY.

Reader, I must take you still further into my confidence.  What you have
already read is strange, but certain things which subsequently happened
to me were even still stranger.

I held that astounding letter in my hand.  My eyes were riveted upon it.

The words written there were puzzling indeed.  A dozen times I read them
through, agape with wonder.

The communication, upon the notepaper of the _Bath Hotel_ at
Bournemouth, was dated June 4, 1891--five years before--and ran as
follows:--

"Dear Mr Heaton,--

"I very much regret that you should have thus misunderstood me.  I
thought when we met at Windermere you were quite of my opinion.  You,
however, appear to have grown tired after the five months of our
engagement, and your love for me has suddenly cooled; therefore our
paths in life must in future lie apart.  You have at least told me the
truth honestly and straightforwardly.  I, of course, believed that your
declarations were true, and that you really loved me truly, but alas! it
is evidently not so.  I can only suffer in silence.  Good-bye for ever.
We shall never, never meet again.  But I tell you, Wilford, that I bear
you no malice, and that my prayers will ever be for your welfare and
your happiness.  Perhaps sometimes you will give a passing thought to
the sorrowful, heart-broken woman who still loves you.

"Mabel Anson."

What could this mean?  It spoke of our engagement for five months!  I
had no knowledge whatever of ever having declared the secret of my love,
much less becoming her affianced husband.  Was it possible that in the
first few months of my unconscious life I had met her and told her of my
affection, of how I worshipped her with all the strength of my being?

As I sat there with the carefully preserved letter in my hand there
arose before my eyes a vision of her calm, fair face, bending over the
piano, her handsome profile illumined by the candles on either side, the
single diamond suspended by its invisible chain, gleaming at her throat
like a giant's eye.  The impression I had obtained of her on that night
at The Boltons still remained indelibly with me.  Yes, her beauty was
superb, her sweetness unsurpassed by that of any other woman I had ever
met.

Among the other private papers preserved within the wallet were four
scraps of notepaper with typewriting upon them.  All bore the same
signature--that of the strange name "Avel."  All of them made
appointments.  One asked me to meet the writer in the writing-room of
the _Hotel Victoria_ in London, another made an appointment to meet me
"on the Promenade at Eastbourne opposite the Wish Tower"; a third
suggested my office at Winchester House as a meeting-place, and the
fourth gave a rendezvous on the departure platform at King's Cross
Station.

I fell to wondering whether I had kept any of these engagements.  The
most recent of the letters was dated nearly two years ago.

But the afternoon was wearing on, therefore I placed the puzzling
communications in my pocket and ascended to my room in order to rest,
and thus carry out the feint of attending to old Britten's directions.

The dressing-bell awakened me, but, confident in the knowledge that I
should remain undisturbed, I removed the bandages from my head, bathed
the wound, and applied some plaster in the place of the handkerchief.
Then, with my hat on, my injury was concealed.

The sun was declining when I managed to slip out of the house
unobserved, and set forth down the avenue to Littleham village.  The
quaint old place was delightful in the evening calm, but, heedless of
everything, I hurried forward down the hill to Withycombe Raleigh, and
thence straight across the open country to Lympston station, where I
took a third-class ticket for Exeter.  At a wayside station a passenger
for London is always remarked, therefore I only booked as far as the
junction with the main-line.

At Exeter I found that the up-mail was not due for ten minutes,
therefore I telegraphed to London for a room at the _Grand Hotel_, and
afterwards bought some newspapers with which to while away the journey.

Sight of newspapers dated six years later than those I had last seen
aroused within me a lively curiosity.  How incredible it all seemed as
in that dimly lit railway-carriage I sat gathering from those printed
pages the history of the lost six years of my life!

The only other occupant of the compartment besides myself was a woman.
I had sought an empty carriage, but failing to find one, was compelled
to accept her as travelling companion.  She was youngish, perhaps
thirty-five, and neatly dressed, but her face, as far as I could
distinguish it through her spotted veil, was that of a woman melancholy
and bowed down by trouble.  In her dark hair were premature threads of
silver, and her deep-sunken eyes, peering forth strangely at me, were
the eyes of a woman rendered desperate.

I did not like the look of her.  In travelling one is quick to entertain
an instinctive dislike to one's companion, and it was so in my case.  I
found myself regretting that I had not entered a smoking-carriage.  But
I soon became absorbed in my papers, and forgot her presence.

It was only her voice, a curiously high-pitched one, that made me start.

She inquired if I minded her closing the window because of the draught,
and I at once closed it, responding rather frigidly, I believe.

But she was in no humour to allow the conversation to drop and commenced
to chat with a familiarity that surprised me.

She noticed how puzzled I became, and at length remarked with a laugh--

"You apparently don't recognise me, Mr Heaton."

"No, madam," I answered, taken aback.  "You have certainly the advantage
of me."

This recognition was startling, for was I not flying to London to escape
my friends?  This woman, whoever she was, would without doubt recount
her meeting with me.

"It is really very droll," she laughed.  "I felt sure from the first,
when you entered the compartment, that you didn't know me."

"I certainly don't know you," I responded coldly--

She smiled.  "Ah!  I expect it's my veil," she said.

"But it's really remarkable that you should not recognise Joliot, your
wife's maid."

"You!  My wife's maid!"  I gasped, recognising in an instant how
cleverly I had been run to earth.

"Yes," she replied.  "Surely you recognise me?" and she raised her veil,
displaying a rather unprepossessing face, dark and tragic, as though
full of some hidden, sorrow.

I had never seen the woman before in my life, but instantly I resolved
to display no surprise and act with caution.

"Ah, of course!"  I said lamely.  "The light here is so bad, you know,
that I didn't recognise you.  And where are you going?"

"To London--to the dressmaker's."

"Mrs Heaton has sent you on some commission, I suppose?"

"Yes, sir."

"You joined this train at Exeter, then?"

"I came from Exmouth to Exeter, and changed," she explained.  "I saw you
get in at Lympston."  My heart sank within me.  It was evident that this
woman had been sent by my self-styled wife to keep watch upon my
movements.  If I intended to escape I should be compelled to make terms
with her.

Those sharp dark eyes, with a curious light in them--eyes that seemed
strangely staring and vacant at times--were fixed upon me, while the
smile about her thin lips was clearly one of triumph, as though she had
caught me in the act of flying from my home.

I reflected, but next moment resolved to take her into my confidence.  I
disliked her, for her manner was somewhat eccentric, and, furthermore, I
had only her own word that she was really maid to that angular woman who
called herself my wife.  Nevertheless, I could do naught else than make
a bargain with her.

"Now," I said at last, after some desultory conversation, "I want to
make a suggestion to you.  Do you think that if I gave you a ten-pound
note you could forget having met me to-night?  Do you think that you
could forget having seen me at all?"

"Forget?  I don't understand."

"Well, to put it plainly, I'm going to London, and I have no desire that
anybody should know that I'm there," I explained.  "When I am found to
be missing from Denbury, Mrs Heaton will do all in her power to
discover me.  You are the only person who knows that I've gone to
London, and I want you to hold your tongue."

She smiled again, showing an even row of white teeth.

"I was sent by my mistress to travel by this train and to see where you
went," she said bluntly.

"Exactly as I thought," I answered.  "Now, you will accept this as a
little present, and return to Denbury to-morrow after a fruitless
errand--utterly fruitless, you understand?"

She took the ten sovereigns I handed her, and transferred them to her
purse, promising to say nothing of having met me.

I gathered from her subsequent conversation that she had been maid to
Mrs Heaton ever since her marriage, and that she had acted as
confidential servant.  Many things she mentioned incidentally were of
the greatest interest to me, yet they only served to show how utterly
ignorant I was of all the past.

"But why did you disclose your identity?"  I inquired, when the lights
showed that we were entering the London suburbs.

"Because I felt certain that you didn't recognise me," she laughed; "and
I had no wish to spy upon you, knowing as I do that your life is the
reverse of happy."

"Then you pity me, eh?"

"I scarcely think that is the word that one of my position ought to
use," she answered, with some hesitation.  "Your life has, since your
marriage, not been of the happiest, that's certain."

"And so you have no intention of telling any one where I've gone?"  I
asked eagerly.

"None in the least, sir.  Rest assured that I shall say nothing--not a
single word."

"I thank you," I said, and sat back pondering in silence until the train
ran into Waterloo, where we parted, she again reassuring me of her
intention to keep my secret.

I congratulated myself upon a very narrow escape, and, taking a cab,
drove straight to Trafalgar Square.  As I crossed Waterloo Bridge the
long line of lights on the Embankment presented the same picture as they
had ever done.  Though six years had passed since I had last had
knowledge of London, nothing had apparently changed.  The red
night-glare in the leaden sky was still the same; the same unceasing
traffic; the same flashing of bright dresses and glittering jewels as
hansoms passed and repassed in the Strand--just as I had known London by
night during all my life.

The gold-braided porter at the _Grand_ handed me out of the cab, and I
ascended by the lift to the room allotted to me like a man in a dream.
It hardly seemed possible that I could have been absent in mind from
that whirling, fevered world of London for six whole years.  I had given
a false name in the reception bureau, fearing that those people who
called themselves my friends--Heaven save the mark!--might make
inquiries and cause my arrest as a wandering lunatic.  I had no baggage,
and I saw that the hotel-clerk looked upon me with some suspicion.
Indeed, I threw down a couple of sovereigns, well knowing the rules that
no person without luggage was taken unless he paid a deposit beforehand.

I laughed bitterly within myself.  How strange it was!

Next morning I went forth and wandered down the Strand--the dear old
Strand that I had once loved so well.  No; it had in no wise changed,
except, perhaps, that two or three monster buildings had sprung up, and
that the theatres announced pieces quite unknown to me.  A sudden desire
seized me to see what kind of place was my own office.  If, however, I
went near there, I might, I reflected, be recognised by some one who
knew me.  Therefore I turned into a barber's and had my beard cut off,
then, further on, bought a new dust coat and another hat.  In that
disguise I took a hansom to Old Broad Street.

I was not long in finding the business headquarters of my own self.  How
curious it all was!  My name was marked upon a huge brass plate in the
entrance-hall of that colossal block of offices, and I ascended to the
first floor to find my name inscribed upon the door of one of the
largest of the suites.  I stood in the corridor carelessly reading a
paper, and while doing so witnessed many persons, several of them
smart-looking City men, leave, as though much business was being
conducted within.

Fortunately, no one recognised me, and descending, I regained the
street.

When outside I glanced up, and there saw my name, in big gilt letters,
upon the wire blinds of six big windows.

If I were actually as well known in the City as Gedge had alleged, then
it was dangerous for me to remain in that vicinity.  Therefore I entered
another cab and drove to my old chambers in Essex Street.

Up the thin-worn creaking stairs of the dismal, smoke-begrimed old place
I climbed, but on arrival at my door a plate confronting me showed that
Percival and Smale, solicitors, were now the occupants.  From inquiries
I made of Mr Smale, it appeared that they had occupied the floor as
offices for the past three years, and that the tenants previous to them
had been a firm of accountants.  He knew nothing of my tenancy, and
could tell me no word of either old Mrs Parker or of Dick Doyle, who
had, it appeared, also vacated his quarters long ago.  That afternoon I
wandered in the Park, over that same road where I had lingered with
Mabel in those cherished days bygone.  Every tree and every object
brought back to me sweet memories of her.  But I remembered her letters
reposing in my pocket, and bit my lip.  Truly, in the unconscious life
when I had been my other self, my real tastes had been inverted.  My
love for her had cooled.  I had actually, when engaged to her, cast her
aside.

It was incredible.  Surely my experience was unique in all the world.

Unable to decide how to act in those puzzling circumstances, I spent
fully a couple of hours in the Park.  The Row was hot, dusty, and almost
deserted, but at last I turned into the shady walks in Kensington
Gardens, and wandered until I came out into the High Street by that same
gate where she had once discovered the dead man's pencil-case in my
possession.

As I stood there in the full light of that glaring afternoon, the whole
scene came back vividly to me.  She had known that man who had been so
foully murdered in her mother's home.  I must, at all costs, find her,
clear myself, and elucidate the truth.

Hence, with that object, I hailed another cab, and, giving the man
directions to drive to The Boltons, sat back, eager and wondering.

As the conveyance drew up my heart gave a leap for joy, for I saw by the
blinds that the house was still occupied.

I sprang out and rang the visitors' bell.





THE MASTER HAND.

A man-servant answered my summons.

"Mrs Anson?"  I inquired.

"Mrs Anson is out of town, sir," answered the man.  "The house is let."

"Furnished?"

"Yes, sir."

"Is your mistress at home?"  I inquired.

"I don't know, sir," answered the man, diplomatically.

"Oh, of course!"  I exclaimed, taking out a card.  It was the first I
found within my cigarette-case, and was intentionally not my own.  "Will
you take this to your mistress, and ask her if she will kindly spare me
a few moments.  I am a friend of Mrs Anson's."

"I'll see if she's at home, sir," said the man, dubiously; and then,
asking me into the entrance-hall, he left me standing while he went in
search of his mistress.

That hall was the same down which I had groped my way when blind.  I saw
the closed door of the drawing-room, and knew that within that room the
young man whose name I knew not had been foully done to death.  There
was the very umbrella stand from which I had taken the walking-stick,
and the door of the little-used library, which I had examined on that
night when I had dined there at Mrs Anson's invitation--the last night
of my existence as my real self.

The man returned in a few moments and invited me into a room on the
left--the morning-room, I supposed it to be--saying:

"My mistress is at home, sir, and will see you."

I had not remained there more than a couple of minutes before a youngish
woman of perhaps thirty or so entered, with a rather distant bow.  She
was severely dressed in black; dark-haired, and not very prepossessing.
Her lips were too thick to be beautiful, and her top row of teeth seemed
too much in evidence.  Her face was not exactly ugly, but she was by no
means good-looking.

"I have to apologise," I said, rising and bowing.  "I understand that
Mrs Anson has let her house, and I thought you would kindly give me her
address.  I wish to see her on a most pressing personal matter."

She regarded me with some suspicion, I thought.

"If you are a friend of Mrs Anson's, would it not be better if you
wrote to her and addressed the letter here?  Her letters are always
forwarded," she answered.

She was evidently a rather shrewd and superior person.

"Well, to tell the truth," I said, "I have reasons for not writing."

"Then I must regret, sir, that I am unable to furnish you with her
address," she responded, somewhat stiffly.

"I have been absent from London for six years," I exclaimed.  "It is
because of that long absence that I prefer not to write."

"I fear that I cannot assist you," she replied briefly.

There was a strange, determined look in her dark-grey eyes.  She did not
seem a person amenable to argument.

"But it is regarding an urgent and purely private affair that I wish to
see Mrs Anson," I said.

"I have nothing whatever to do with the private affairs of Mrs Anson,"
she replied.  "I merely rent this house from her, and, in justice to
her, it is not likely that I give the address to every chance caller."

"I am no chance caller," I responded.  "During her residence here six
years ago I was a welcome guest at her table."

"Six years ago is a long time.  You may, for aught I know, not be so
welcome now."

Did she, I wondered, speak the truth?

"You certainly speak very plainly, madam," I answered, rising stiffly.
"If I have put you to any inconvenience I regret it.  I can, no doubt,
obtain from some other person the information I require."

"Most probably you can, sir," she answered, in a manner quite unruffled.
"I tell you that if you write I shall at once forward your letter to
her.  More than that I cannot do."

"I presume you are acquainted with Miss Mabel Anson?"  I inquired.

She smiled with some sarcasm.

"The Anson family do not concern me in the least, sir," she replied,
also rising as sign that my unfruitful interview was at an end.  Mention
of Mabel seemed to have irritated her, and although I plied her with
further questions, she would tell me absolutely nothing.

When I bowed and took my leave I fear that I did not show her very much
politeness.

In my eagerness for information, her hesitation to give me Mrs Anson's
address never struck me as perfectly natural.  She, of course, did not
know me, and her offer to forward a letter was all that she could do in
such circumstances.  Yet at the time I did not view it in that light,
but regarded the tenant of that house of mystery as an ill-mannered and
extremely disagreeable person.

In despair I returned to St James's Street and entered my club, the
Devonshire.  Several men whom I did not know greeted me warmly in the
smoking-room, and, from their manner, I saw that in my lost years I had
evidently not abandoned that institution.  They chatted to me about
politics and stocks, two subjects upon which I was perfectly ignorant,
and I was compelled to exercise considerable tact and ingenuity in order
to avoid betraying the astounding blank in my mind.

After a restless hour I drove back westward and called at old Channing's
in Cornwall Gardens in an endeavour to learn Mabel's address.  The
colonel was out, but I saw Mrs Channing, and she could, alas! tell me
nothing beyond the fact that Mrs Anson and her daughter had been abroad
for three years past--where, she knew not.  They had drifted apart, she
said, and never now exchanged letters.

"Is Mabel married?"  I inquired as carelessly as I could, although in
breathless eagerness.

"I really don't know," she responded.  "I have heard some talk of the
likelihood of her marrying, but whether she has done so I am unaware."

"And the man whom rumour designated as her husband?  Who was he?"  I
inquired quickly.

"A young nobleman, I believe."

"You don't know his name?"

"No.  It was mentioned at the time, but it has slipped my memory.  One
takes no particular notice of teacup gossip."

"Well, Mrs Channing," I said confidently, "I am extremely desirous of
discovering the whereabouts of Mabel Anson.  I want to see her upon a
rather curious matter which closely concerns herself.  Can you tell me
of any one who is intimate with them?"

"Unfortunately, I know of no one," she answered.  "The truth is, that
they left London quite suddenly; and, indeed, it was a matter for
surprise that they neither paid farewell visits nor told any of their
friends where they were going."

"Curious," I remarked--"very curious!"

Then there was, I reflected, apparently some reason for the present
tenant at The Boltons refusing the address.

"Yes," Mrs Channing went on, "it was all very mysterious.  Nobody knows
the real truth why they went abroad so suddenly and secretly.  It was
between three and four years ago now, and nothing, to my knowledge, has
since been heard of them."

"Very mysterious," I responded.  "It would seem almost as though they
had some reason for concealing their whereabouts."

"That's just what lots of people have said.  You may depend upon it that
there is something very mysterious in it all.  We were such very close
friends for years, and it is certainly strange that Mrs Anson has never
confided in me the secret of her whereabouts."

I remembered the old colonel's strange warning on that evening long ago,
when I had first met Mabel at his table.  What, I wondered, could he
know of them to their detriment?

I remained for a quarter of an hour longer.  The colonel's wife was full
of the latest tittle-tattle, as the wife of an _ex-attache_ always is.
It is part of the diplomatic training to be always well-informed in the
sayings and doings of our neighbours; and as I allowed her to gossip on
she revealed to me many things of which I was in ignorance.  Nellie, her
daughter, had, it appeared, married the son of a Newcastle shipowner a
couple of years before, and now lived near Berwick-on-Tweed.

Suddenly a thought occurred to me, and I asked whether she knew Miss
Wells or the man Hickman, who had been my fellow-guests on that night
when I had dined at The Boltons.

"I knew a Miss Wells--a very pronounced old maid, who was a friend of
hers," answered Mrs Channing.  "But she caught influenza about a year
ago, and died of it.  She lived in Edith Villas, Kensington."

"And Hickman, a fair man, of middle age, with a very ugly face?"

She reflected.

"I have no recollection of ever having met him, or of hearing of him,"
she answered.  "Was he an intimate friend?"

"I believe so," I said.  Then, finding that she could explain nothing
more, I took my leave.

Next day and the next I wandered about London aimlessly and without
hope.  Mabel and her mother had, for some unaccountable reason, gone
abroad and carefully concealed their whereabouts.  Had this fact any
connexion with the mysterious tragedy that had been enacted at The
Boltons?  That one thought was ever uppermost in my mind.

A week passed, and I still remained at the _Grand_, going forth each
day, wandering hither and thither, but never entering the club or going
to places where I thought it likely that I might be recognised.  I could
not return to the life at Denbury with that angular woman at the head of
my table--the woman who called herself my wife.  If I returned I felt
that the mystery of it all must drive me to despair, and I should, in a
fit of desperation, commit suicide.

I ask any of those who read this strange history of my life, whether
they consider themselves capable of remaining calm and tranquil in such
circumstances, or of carefully going over all the events in their
sequence and considering them with logical reasoning.  I tried to do so,
but in vain.  For hours I sat within the hotel smoking and thinking.  I
was living an entirely false life, existing in the fear of recognition
by unknown friends, and the constant dread that sooner or later I must
return to that hated life in Devonshire.

That a hue-and-cry had been raised regarding my disappearance was plain
from a paragraph which I read in one of the morning papers about ten
days after my departure from Denbury.  In the paragraph I was designated
as "a financier well known in the City," and it was there stated that I
had left my home suddenly "after betraying signs of insanity," and had
not since been heard of.

"Insanity!"  I laughed bitterly as I read those lines supplied by the
Exeter correspondent of the Central News.  The police had, no doubt,
received my description, and were actively on the watch to trace me and
restore me to my "friends."

For nearly a fortnight I had been in hiding, and was now on the verge of
desperation.  By means of one of the cheques I had taken from Denbury I
succeeded in drawing a good round sum without my bankers being aware of
my address, and was contemplating going abroad in order to avoid the
possibility of being put under restraint as a lunatic, when one evening,
in the dusky, sunset, I went forth and wandered down Northumberland
Avenue to the Victoria Embankment.  In comparison with the life and
bustle of the Strand and Trafalgar Square, the wide roadway beside the
Thames is always quiet and reposeful.  Upon that same pavement over
which I now strolled in the direction of the Temple I had, in the days
of my blindness, taken my lessons in walking alone.  That pavement had
been my practice-ground on summer evenings under the tender guidance of
poor old Parker, the faithful servant now lost to me.  My eyesight had
now grown as strong as that of other men.  The great blank in my mind
was all that distinguished me from my fellows.  During those past
fourteen days I had been probing a period which I had not lived, and
ascertaining by slow degrees the events of my unknown past.

And as I strolled along beneath the plane trees over that broad pavement
I recollected that the last occasion I had been there was on that
memorable evening when I had lost myself, and was subsequently present
at the midnight tragedy in that house of mystery.  I gazed around.

In the ornamental gardens, bright with geraniums, some tired Londoners
were taking their ease upon the seats provided by that most paternal of
all metropolitan institutions, the London County Council; children were
shouting as they played at ball and hopscotch, that narrow strip of
green being, alas! all they knew of Nature's beauty outside their world
of bricks and mortar.  The slight wind stirred the dusty foliage of the
trees beneath which I walked, while to the left river-steamers belched
forth volumes of black smoke, and barges slowly floated down with the
tide.  On either side were great buildings, and straight before the dome
of St Paul's.  Over all was that golden, uncertain haze which in
central London is called sunset, the light which so quickly turns to
cold grey, without any of those glories of crimson and gold which those
in the country associate with the summer sun's decline.

That walk induced within me melancholy thoughts of a wasted life.  I
loved Mabel Anson--I loved her with all my soul.  Now that marriage with
her was no longer within the range of possibility I was inert and
despairing, utterly heedless of everything.  I had, if truth be told, no
further desire for life.  All joy within me was now blotted out.

At length, at Blackfriars Bridge, I retraced my steps, and some twenty
minutes later, as I took my key from the hotel bureau, the clerk handed
me a note, addressed to "Burton Lawrence, Esquire," the fictitious name
I had given.  It had been delivered by boy-messenger.

Then I was discovered!  My heart leapt into my mouth.

I tore open the envelope, and read its contents.  They were brief and to
the point.

"The undersigned will be obliged," it ran, "if Mr Burton Lawrence will
be present this evening at eight o'clock, in the main-line
booking-office of the Brighton Railway, at Victoria Station.  An
interview is of very pressing importance."

The note was signed, by that single word which had always possessed such
mysterious signification, the word "Avel."

Hitherto, in my old life long ago, receipt of communications from that
mysterious correspondent had caused me much anxiety of mind.  I had
always feared their advent; now, however, I actually welcomed it, even
though it were strange and unaccountable that the unknown writer should
know my whereabouts and the name beneath which I had sought to conceal
my identity.

I made a hasty dinner in the coffee-room, and went forthwith to
Victoria, wondering whom I should meet.  The last time I had kept one of
those strange appointments on that summer evening long ago in Hyde Park,
I had come face to face with the woman I loved.  Would that I could meet
her now!

I entered the booking-office, searching it with eager eyes.  Two lines
of persons were taking tickets at the pigeon-holes, while a number of
loungers were, like myself, awaiting friends.  Beyond, upon the
platform, all was bustle as is usual at that hour, when the belated
portion of business London is bound for the southern suburbs.  From that
busy terminus of the West End trains were arriving and departing each
minute.

The big illumined clock showed that it was yet five minutes to the hour.
Therefore I strolled out upon the platform, lounged around the
bookstalls, and presently returned to the spot indicated in the letter.

As I re-entered the booking-office my eager eyes fell upon a figure
standing before me--a well-dressed figure, with a face that smiled upon
me.

An involuntary cry of surprise escaped my lips.  The encounter was
sudden and astounding; but in that instant, as I rushed forward to greet
the new-comer, I knew myself to be on the verge of a startling and
remarkable discovery.





THE PERSON WHO KNEW.

The encounter was a startling one.

At the moment when my eyes first fell upon the figure standing patiently
in the booking-office awaiting me, I halted for a second in uncertainty.
The silhouette before me was that of a youngish, brown-haired, and
rather good-looking woman, neatly dressed in dead black, wearing a large
hat and a feather boa round her neck.

By the expression of her face I saw that she had recognised me.  I had,
of course, never seen her before, yet her personal appearance--the grey
eyes and brown hair--were exactly similar to those described so minutely
on several occasions by West, the cab-driver.  I regarded her for a
moment in silent wonder, then advanced to meet her.

She was none other than the unknown woman who had saved my life on that
fateful night at The Boltons--the mysterious Edna!

As I raised my hat she bowed gracefully, and with a merry smile, said:
"I fear that, to you, I am a stranger.  I recognise you, however, as Mr
Heaton."

"That is certainly my name," I responded, still puzzled.  "And you--
well, our recognition is, I believe, mutual--you are Edna."

She glanced at me quickly, as though suspicious.  "How did you know
that?" she inquired.  "You have never seen me before.  You were totally
blind on the last occasion we met."

"I recognised you from your description," I answered with a light laugh.

"My description!" she echoed in a tone of distinct alarm.

"Yes, the description given of you by the cabman who drove me home on
that memorable morning."

"Ah!  Of course," she ejaculated in sudden remembrance.  Then, for a few
seconds, she remained in silence.  It seemed as though the fact that I
had recognised her had somewhat confused her.

"But I am extremely glad that we have met at last," I assured her.  "I
have, times without number, hoped to have an opportunity of thanking you
for the great services you once rendered me."

"I find with satisfaction that although six years have gone by you have
not forgotten your promise made to me," she said, her large serious eyes
fixed upon mine.

"I gave you that promise in exchange for my life," I remarked, as, at
her suggestion, we turned and walked out of the station.

"And as acknowledgement of the service you rendered by preserving secret
your knowledge of the events of that terrible night I was enabled to
render you a small service in return," she said.  "Your sight was
restored to you."

"For that, how can I sufficiently thank you?"  I exclaimed.  "I owe it
all to you, and rest assured that, although we have not met until this
evening, I have never forgotten--nor shall I ever forget."

She smiled pleasantly, while I strolled slowly at her side across the
station-yard.

To me those moments were like a dream.  Edna, the woman who had hitherto
been but a strange ghost of the past, was now actually beside me in the
flesh.

"I have received other notes making appointments--the last, I think, a
couple of years ago," I observed after a pause.  "Did you not meet me
then?"

She glanced at me with a puzzled expression.  Of course she knew nothing
of those lost years of my life.

"Meet you?" she repeated.  "Certainly not."

"Who met me, then?"

"I really don't know," she answered.  "This is the first time I have
approached you, and I only come to you now in order to ask you to grant
me a favour--a very great favour."

"A favour!  What is it?"

"I cannot explain here, in the street," she said quickly.  "If you will
come to my hotel I will place the facts before you."

"Where are you staying?"

"At the _Bath Hotel_, in Arlington Street."

I knew the place well.  It stood at the corner of Arlington Street and
Piccadilly, and was an eminently respectable, old-fashioned place,
patronised by a high-class clientele.

"And you are alone?"  I inquired, thinking it strange that she should
thus ask me to her hotel.

"Of course.  I have come to London expressly to see you," she responded.
"I went down to Budleigh-Salterton two days ago, but I ascertained at
Denbury that you had left suddenly."

"Whom did you see there?"  I inquired, much interested.

"Your butler.  He told me some absurd story, how that you had become
temporarily irresponsible for your actions, and had disappeared, leaving
no address."

"And you came to London?"

"Of course."

"And how did you find out where I was hidden, and my assumed name?"

She smiled mysteriously.

"It was easy enough, I assure you.  A man of your influence in the City,
and as well known as you are, has considerable difficulty in effectively
concealing his identity."

"But who told you where I was staying?"  I demanded.

"Nobody.  I discovered it for myself."

"And yet the police have been searching for me everywhere, and have not
yet discovered me!"  I remarked, surprised.

"The police have one method," she said.  "I have an entirely different
one."

"Tell me one thing," I said, halting in our walk, for we were already at
the commencement of Victoria Street--that street down which I had
wandered blindly on that night long ago when I had lost myself--"tell me
for what reason those previous appointments were made with me at
Grosvenor Gate, at King's Cross, at Eastbourne, and elsewhere?"

"You kept them," she replied.  "You surely know."

"No, that's just it," I said.  "Of course, I don't expect you to give
credence to what I say--it sounds too absurd--but I have absolutely no
knowledge of keeping those appointments except the one at Grosvenor
Gate, and I am totally ignorant of having met anybody."  She paused,
looking me full in the face with those grey eyes so full of mystery.

"I begin to think that what the butler told me contains some truth," she
observed bluntly.

"No," I protested.  "My mind is in no way unhinged.  I am fully aware of
all that transpired at The Boltons, of--"

"At The Boltons?" she interrupted, turning a trifle pale.  "What do you
mean?"

"Of the crime enacted at that house--in The Boltons."  She held her
breath.  Plainly she was not before aware that I had discovered the spot
where the tragedy had taken place.  My words had taken her by surprise,
and it was evident that she was utterly confounded.  My discovery I had
kept a profound secret unto myself, and now, for the first time, had
revealed it.

Her face showed how utterly taken aback she was.  "There is some
mistake, I think," she said lamely, apparently for want of something
other to say.

"Surely your memory carries you back to that midnight tragedy!"  I
exclaimed rather hastily, for I saw she would even now mislead me, if
she could.  "I have discovered where it took place--I have since
re-entered that room?"

"You have!" she gasped in the low, hoarse voice of one fearful lest her
secret should be discovered.  "You have actually re-discovered the
house--even though you were stone blind?"

"Yes," I answered.

"How did you accomplish it?"

I shrugged my shoulders, answering: "There is an old saying--a very true
one--that `murder will out.'"

"But tell me more.  Explain more fully," she urged in an earnest tone.

I hesitated.  Next instant, however, I decided to keep my own counsel in
the matter.  Her readiness to deny that the events occurred in that
house had re-aroused within me a distinct suspicion.

"It is a long story, and cannot be told here," I answered evasively.

"Then come along to the hotel," she suggested.  "I, too, have much to
say to you."

I do not know that I should have obeyed her were it not for the mystery
which had hitherto, veiled her identity.  She had saved my life, it is
true, and I supposed that I ought to consider her as a friend, yet in
those few minutes during which I had gazed upon her a curious dislike of
her had arisen within me.  She was, I felt certain, not the
straightforward person I had once believed her to be.

Not that there was anything in her appearance against her.  On the
contrary, she was a pleasant, smiling, rather pretty woman of perhaps
thirty-five, who spoke with the air and manner of a lady, and who
carried herself well, with the grace of one in a higher social circle.

After a few moments' hesitation my curiosity got the better of my
natural caution, and I determined to hear what she had to say.
Therefore we drove together to the _Bath Hotel_.

In her own private sitting-room, a cosy little apartment overlooking
Piccadilly, opposite Dover Street, she removed her big black hat, drew
off her gloves, and having invited me to a chair, took one herself on
the opposite side of the fireplace.  Her maid was there when we entered,
but retired at word from her mistress.

"You, of course, regard it as very curious, Mr Heaton, that after these
six years I should again seek you," she commenced, leaning her arm
lightly upon the little table, and gazing straight into my face without
flinching.  "It is true that once I was enabled to render you a service,
and now in return I ask you also to render me one.  Of course, it is
useless to deny that a secret exists between us--a secret which, if
revealed, would be disastrous."

"To whom?"

"To certain persons whose names need not be mentioned."

"Why not?"

"Think," she said, very gravely.  "Did you not promise that, in return
for your life when you were blind and helpless, you would make no effort
to learn the true facts?  It seems that you have already learnt at least
one--the spot where the crime was committed."

"I consider it my duty to learn what I can of this affair," I answered
determinedly.

She raised her eyebrows with an expression of surprise, for she saw that
I was in earnest.

"After your vow to me?" she asked.  "Remember that, to acknowledge my
indebtedness for that vow, I searched for the one specialist who could
restore your sight.  To my efforts, Mr Heaton, you are now in
possession of that sense that was lost to you."

"I acknowledge that freely," I answered.  "Yet, even in that you have
sought to deceive me."

"How?"

"You told me you were not the writer of those letters signed with a
pseudonym."

"And that is true.  I was not the actual writer, even though I may have
caused them to be written."

"Having thus deceived me, how can you hope that I can be free with you?"

"I regret," she answered, "that slight deception has been necessary to
preserve the secret?"

"The secret of the crime?"

She nodded.

"Well, and what do you wish to tell me this evening?"  She was silent
for a moment, toying with her rings.

"I want to appeal to your generosity.  I want you to assist me."

"In what manner?"

"As before."

"As before!"  I repeated, greatly surprised.  "I have no knowledge of
having assisted you before."

"What?" she cried.  "Is your memory so defective that you do not
recollect your transactions with those who waited upon you--those who
kept the previous appointments of which you have spoken?"

"I assure you, madam," I said, quite calmly, "I have not the least idea
of what you mean."

"Mr Heaton!" she cried.  "Have you really taken leave of your senses?
Is it actually true what your butler has said of you--that on the day
you left Denbury you behaved like a madman?"

"I am no madman!"  I cried with considerable warmth.  "The truth is that
I remember nothing since one evening, nearly six years ago, when I was
smoking with--with a friend--in Chelsea, until that day to which my
servant has referred."

"You remember nothing?  That is most extraordinary."

"If strange to you, madam, how much more strange to me?  I have told you
the truth, therefore kindly proceed to explain the object of these
previous visits of persons you have apparently sent to me."

"I really think that you must be joking," she said.  "It seems
impossible that you should actually be unaware."

"I tell you that I have no knowledge whatsoever of their business with
me."

"Then if such is really the case, let me explain," she said.  "First, I
think you will admit that your financial transactions with our
Government have brought you very handsome profits."

"I am not aware of having had any transactions with the British
Government," I answered.

"I refer to that of Bulgaria," she explained.  "Surely you are aware
that through my intermediary you have obtained great concessions--the
docks at Varna, the electric trams at Sofia, the railway from Timova to
the Servian frontier, not to mention other great undertakings which have
been floated as companies, all of which are now earning handsome
profits.  You cannot be ignorant of that!"

I remembered that Gedge had shown me some official parchment which he
had explained were concessions obtained from Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria.  That this woman had been the means of securing to me the
greater part of the enormous profits which I had apparently made within
the past five years was certainly surprising.

"On the day I recovered consciousness--the day of my departure from
Denbury--I was shown some documents, but took but little heed of them,"
I said.

"You admit, however, that the employment of British capital in Bulgaria
has realised a very handsome profit, and that the greater part of it has
gone into your own pockets?"

"I suppose that is so," I responded.  "Is it to you that I am indebted
for those concessions?"

"Certainly."

"Are you, then, an ambassadress of the Principality of Bulgaria?"

"Well, yes--if you choose to put it so."

"Then, as I understand, it is with some further financial object that
you have sought me this evening?"

"Exactly."

This latest development of the affair was certainly most remarkable.  I
had never dreamed that to this hitherto unknown woman I had been
indebted for the unparalleled success which had attended my career
during those past six years.  Yet, from the facts she subsequently
placed before me, it would seem that it was at her instigation that I
first dabbled in finance.  She, or rather her agents, had obtained for
me the negotiation of a substantial loan to Prince Ferdinand, and this
had been followed by all sorts of concessions, not one of which had
tuned out badly.

The mysterious Edna, whom I had always believed to be a typical
blouse-and-bicycle girl of the true Kensington type, was actually a
political agent of that most turbulent of all the European States.

I sat looking at her in wonderment.  She possessed a superb carriage, a
smart, well-dressed figure, a smiling, intelligent face, white, even
teeth, a complexion just a trifle dark, but betraying no trace of
foreign birth.  Her English was perfect, her manner purely that of the
patrician, while her surprising tact possessed all the _finesse_ of an
accomplished diplomatist.

"I confess that I have all along been in entire ignorance of my
indebtedness to you," I said, after listening to her while she explained
how obediently I had followed the instructions contained in the letters
signed "Avel," and how I had so materially advanced the interests of the
Principality that the thanks of the Bulgarian Parliament, or Sobranje
had been tendered to me, and the Prince himself had a couple of years
ago conferred upon me the highest distinction within his power.

Yet it was more than strange that while this shrewd grey-eyed woman, the
possessor of the secret of that puzzling crime, held aloof from me, she
had ingeniously contrived that I should become the unwitting catspaw of
an unstable State.

I was thinking of Mabel--my thoughts were always of my lost love--and I
was wondering how I might obtain from this woman the secret of her
whereabouts.





EDNA MAKES A PROPOSAL.

"Well," I inquired at last; "and your reason for seeing me this
evening?"

She hesitated, as though uncertain in what manner to place her project
before me.  She moved uneasily, and, rising, drew forth a large
dispatch-box from its leathern case and placed it upon the table.  I
noticed that the outer case bore a count's coronet with a cipher
beneath.

Having opened the box with a tiny gold master-key which hung upon her
bracelet, she drew forth some official-looking papers, and with them
returned to her chair.

"You have already been entrusted with a secret, which you have not
betrayed--the secret of that unfortunate occurrence on the evening when
accident first brought us together," she commenced gravely.  "Therefore
I feel convinced that any further confidence placed in you will not be
abused."

"I am honoured to think, madam, that you should entertain such an
opinion of me," I said, not, however, without the slightest touch of
sarcasm.

I did not forget that she had only rescued me from my enemies in return
for my silence.  She was not a woman to act without strong motives.
Moreover, she had admitted knowledge of that strange midnight crime at
The Boltons, and was, therefore, an accessory after the fact.

"You are the Prince's confidential agent here, in London, and I come to
you on a mission direct from His Serene Highness."

"From Bulgaria?"  I inquired.

"Yes.  I left Sofia a week ago," she answered.  "It was at first
proposed to place the matter in the hands of Guechoff, our diplomatic
representative at the Court of St James's, but, on consideration, His
Serene Highness, knowing that with the present state of high feeling in
the Sobranje a single hint leaking out might prove disastrous, to the
dynasty, and perhaps to the nation, resolved to place the matter
unreservedly in my hands.  The Prince did me the honour of referring in
terms of praise to my previous dealings with you, and instructed me to
lose no time in seeing you and invoking your aid."

"In what direction?"  Was it not amazing that I should awake from my
years of unconsciousness to find myself so powerful in the world of
finance that reigning princes sought my assistance?

"I have here a letter from His Serene Highness;" and she handed me a
note which bore the Bulgarian royal arms, and had apparently been
written by the Prince's own hand.  It was merely a formal note asking me
to consider the secret proposals which would be placed before me by the
bearer.

"Well?"  I inquired, when I had read it.  "Explain."

"Briefly," she said, "the facts are as follows: The throne of Bulgaria,
never very safe owing to the eternal bickering between St Petersburg
and the Porte, is at this moment in imminent danger.  The People's Party
in the Sobranje have been defeated, and the police have learnt of a
projected popular uprising against His Highness in favour of a republic,
the agitation being, of course, caused by paid agents of Russia.  It is
an open secret that Russia, at the first sign of an outbreak, would
endeavour to annex the country, hence the position of the throne grows
each moment more perilous.  Fear of giving offence to Russia prevents
orders being issued for the arrest of the secret agitators, and it seems
therefore as though a revolution cannot long be delayed.  It is your aid
His Serene Highness seeks--your aid to negotiate a loan of half a
million sterling."

"Half a million!"  I ejaculated.  "A large sum!  It seems incredible
that I should be a dealer in millions."

"A large sum, certainly, but you can easily obtain it," she quickly
assured me.  "I have all the necessary preliminaries of the securities
here;" and she pointed to the pile of papers at her side.

"I take it that the money is required for the Prince's private purse?"

"No; solely for defence--to purchase arms and ammunition; to pay the
army the arrears due, so as to secure their support in case of an
outbreak, and to pay certain heavy sums as secret-service money.  All
this is imperative in order to save the country from falling into the
hands of Russia.  But it must be done, of course, in strictest secrecy,
His Highness, as I have already explained, hesitated to entrust the
matter to his recognised minister here because the spies of Russia are
everywhere, and if any knowledge of his intentions leaked out it would
be fatal to his plans."

"And so he trusts me!"  I said, smiling.

"He does, absolutely."

"And where does His Highness think that I am going to get half a million
of money from at a moment's notice, pray?"  I asked with a smile.

"With these in your possession there will be no difficulty," she
responded coolly, indicating the papers.  "There is not a financial
agent in the City of London who would not be only too delighted to,
without its intentions being known."

"But you say it is all a secret," I observed.  "How do you think it
possible that I can raise such a loan without its intentions being
known?"

She laughed outright.

"The money, you will find from the documents here, is ostensibly for the
construction of a new railway from Philippopolis, by the Shipka to
Rustchuk.  The plans are here, properly prepared, so that you need have
no hesitation in showing them to any railway engineer."

I saw that she had been trained in a school of clever diplomacy.

"And you say that security will be given?"

"Certainly.  The proposal is to give the customs receipts.  They would
be ample.  Failing that, it is probable that the Princess's jewels,
which, as you know, include some of the finest pearls in Europe, might
be available.  Of the latter, however, I am not sure."

I remained silent, turning over the papers she had passed across to me.
They were mostly in French, and, therefore, easily understood.  The
documents related to "the long projected scheme of constructing a
railway from Philippopolis to Eski Saghra, thence across the Shipka to
Rasgrad, joining the line already in operation between Varna and
Rustchuk."  Appended were official declarations from the Bulgarian
Minister of Finance, countersigned by the Prince himself.

The documents were certainly very ingeniously contrived so as to conceal
the real purpose of the loan.  I remarked this, and my companion,
laughing lightly, said--

"Deception, to some extent, is always necessary in delicate diplomacy."

The discovery that the mysterious woman--whose name she had withheld
from me--was actually a secret agent of the autonomous Principality
created by the Berlin Treaty--that turbulent State mostly notable for
the assassination of its Ministers--was entirely unlooked for.  On the
night when accident had thrown us together, and she had smoothed my brow
with her cool hand, I had believed her to be a young girl who had taken
pity upon me in my helplessness; but the revelations she had made during
that half-hour showed that there had been some firm purpose underlying
it all.

She alone knew the truth of that tragic occurrence at The Boltons, and I
saw that in this matter I had to deal with a very clever and ingenious
woman.

I had now a double purpose in life--to discover Mabel, and to elucidate
the mystery of the crime.  Towards that end I intended to strive, and as
I sat with my glance fixed upon those mysterious grey eyes, I
endeavoured to form some plan of action.

"Madam," I said gravely, at last, "as you appear not to place sufficient
confidence in me to tell me your name, I regret that I can place no
confidence in these documents."

"My name!" she laughed.  "Ah, of course; I had quite forgotten.  There
is no secret about it;" and from her purse she drew forth a folded,
much-worn blue paper, which she handed to me.

It was an English passport, bearing the name of "Lucy Edna Grainger."

"Grainger?"  I repeated.  "Then you are English?"

"Yes, I am legally a British subject, because my father was English.  I
was, however, born abroad."

A silence fell between us.  The roar of the traffic in Piccadilly came
up from below; the summer night was warm, and the window stood open.  At
last I determined upon a bold course.

"Now that we have met," I said, "I wish to ask you one or two questions.
First, I am desirous of knowing the whereabouts of Mrs Anson and her
daughter."

I was watching her narrowly, and saw her give a distinct start at my
mention of the same.  Next instant, however, she recovered herself, and
with marvellous tact repeated--

"Anson?  Anson?  I have no acquaintance with any person of that name."

I smiled.

"I think it unnecessary that you should deny this, when the truth is so
very plain," I observed sarcastically.  "You will, perhaps, next deny
that a young man was foully murdered within that house in The Boltons;
that you were present, and that you are aware of the identity of those
who committed the crime?"

The pallor of her cheeks showed plainly that I had recalled unwelcome
memories.

"The unfortunate affair is all of the past," she said hoarsely.  "Why
need we discuss it?"

"In the interests of justice," I answered, with firm determination.

"Have you not agreed to remain silent?  Have you not, as recompense,
received back your sight, and become enriched beyond your wildest
dreams?  Surely you, at least, should not complain."

"I complain of the manner in which the secret of the crime has been
preserved," I said.  "I have determined, however, that it shall remain
secret no longer."

"You would inform the police!" she gasped, for the moment unable to
conceal her alarm.

"If you have no knowledge of Mrs Anson, then I intend to invoke the aid
of Scotland Yard in order to discover her."

My words perplexed her.  That she was acquainted with the Ansons I had
no doubt, and I was likewise certain that she would never risk
information being given to the police.  More than once in the days long
past I had entertained a shrewd suspicion that she herself was the
actual murderer of that young unknown man.  I looked at her pale face,
and vaguely wondered again whether such were the truth.

The fact that she had secured my silence in return for my life as an
outcome of that most ingenious conspiracy had seemed to me proof
conclusive of her guilt, and now that we had met in those strange
circumstances the idea became impressed upon me more forcibly than ever.

What might be her real position in the secret diplomacy of Bulgaria I
knew not.  It was evident that considerable confidence was reposed in
her.  She had come to me with a cool demand to raise a loan of half a
million sterling, and it was plain from what she had explained that the
money was urgently needed for the protection of the State against
enemies both internal and external.  My own position was unique.  Had
not Gedge shown me those official documents, which gave me concessions
in the Principality of Bulgaria, I should have laughed this woman's
curious story to scorn as a piece of impossible fiction.  But I had
glanced over some of those papers at Denbury, and was satisfied that I
had actually had many dealings with that State during the six years of
my unconscious but prosperous existence.  There seemed every truth in
her statement that to her had been due my success in the City in the
first instance.

"And supposing you broke your promise and went to Scotland Yard?" she
suggested at length, her eyes still fixed upon me.  "What would you
expect to find?"

"To find?"  I echoed.  "I should find traces of the crime within that
room."

She nodded.  I had expected my words to have some confusing effect upon
her, nevertheless, on the contrary, she remained perfectly calm.  Her
self-control was extraordinary.

"And what would it profit you, pray?" she asked.

"I should at least know that I had endeavoured to bring to justice those
responsible for the poor fellow's death."

"It would only be an endeavour--a vain one, I assure you."

"You mean that the secret is too well concealed ever to be revealed," I
observed quickly.

"Yes," she said; "you have guessed aright."

"And, in other words, you defy me to discover the truth?"

"I have not said so.  The word defy is scarcely one which should be used
between us, I think, considering that our interests are to-day mutual--
just as they were on the night of the crime."

"I fail to see that," I answered.  "I have no interest whatever in
keeping this terrible secret hidden, for while I do so I am acting the
part of accessory."

"But surely you have an interest in preserving your own life?" she
urged.

"Then you imply that if I were to lay information at Scotland Yard I
should be in peril of my life?"  I asked, looking straight into those
calm eyes that ever and anon seemed full of mystery.

"Of that I cannot speak with any degree of certainty," she responded.
"I would only warn you that in this matter continued silence is by far
the best."

"But you have uttered a veiled threat!"  I cried.  "You are aware of the
whole facts, and yet refuse to impart to me the simple information of
the whereabouts of Mrs Anson.  Do you think it possible in such a case
that I can entertain any confidence in you, or in your extraordinary
story regarding the affairs of Bulgaria and its Prince?"

"I am unable to give you any information regarding the lady you
mention," she replied, with a slight frown of annoyance.

"But you are acquainted with her?"

"I may be--what then?"

"I demand to know where she is."

"And in reply I tell you that I am in ignorance."

"In that case," I said angrily, "I refuse to have any further dealings
whatsoever with you.  From the first I became drawn into a trap by you,
bound down and for six years held silent by your threats.  But, madam, I
now tell you plainly of my intentions.  I mean to-morrow to lay the
whole facts before the Director of Criminal Investigations, including
this story of yours regarding the Prince and his people."

She rose slowly from her chair, perfectly calm, her dignity unruffled.
Her manner was absolutely perfect.  Had she been a princess herself she
could not have treated my sudden ebullition of anger with greater
disdain.

She gathered up the papers she had put before me, and, replacing them in
the dispatch-box, locked it with the golden master-key upon her bangle.

Afterwards, she turned to me and said, in a hard distinct voice--

"Then I understand that I have to inform His Serene Highness that you
refuse to assist him further?"

"Tell him whatever you choose, madam," I answered, rising and taking up
my hat and cane.  "I shall, in future, act according to my own
inclinations."

"And at your own risk!" she added, in a harsh voice, as, bowing stiffly
before her, I turned towards the door.

"Yes, madam," I answered; "I accept your challenge--at my own risk."





MORE SCHEMING.

The mellow summer twilight was fast deepening into night as I strode
along Piccadilly towards the Circus, after leaving the grey-eyed woman
who held the secret.

What she had revealed to me was startling, yet the one fact which caused
me more apprehension than all others was the curious means by which she
had discovered my whereabouts.  If she had been enabled to do this, then
the police would, no doubt, very soon find me and return me to my
so-called "friends."

In despair I thought of Mabel.  Long ago I had surrendered my whole
heart to her.  She had at first placed a strong and high-minded
confidence in me, judging me by her own lofty spirit, but that
unaccountable rupture had occurred, and she had gone from me crushed and
heart-broken.  In my pocket I carried her letter, and the more I thought
over it the more puzzled I became.  Daily, hourly, I lamented over the
broken and shattered fragments of all that was fairest on earth; I had
been borne at once from calm, lofty, and delighted speculations into the
very heart of fear and tribulations.  My love for her was now ranked by
myself as a fond record which I must erase for ever from my heart and
brain.  Once I had thought to link my destiny with hers; but, alas!  I
could not now marry her, nor could I reveal to her, knowing them not,
the mysterious influences which had changed the whole current of my life
and purposes.  My secret burden was that of a heart bursting with its
own unuttered grief.

The whole of the events swept past me like a torrent which hurried along
in its dark and restless course all those about me towards some
overwhelming catastrophe.  Tormented by remorseful doubts and pursued by
distraction, I felt assured that Mabel, in her unresisting tenderness,
her mournful sweetness, her virgin innocence, was doomed to perish by
that relentless power which had linked her destiny with crime and
contest in which she had no part but as a sufferer.  It is, alas! the
property of crime to extend its mischiefs over innocence, as it is of
virtue to extend its blessing over many that deserve them not.

Plunged in that sea of troubles, of perplexities, of agonies, and of
terrors, I reflected upon all that the woman Edna had told me.  It
seemed inconceivable that Bulgaria's ruler should demand assistance of
me--and yet it was undoubtedly true.

Presently I turned down the Haymarket, still walking slowly, deep in
reflection.

Should I inform the police?  Very calmly I thought it over.  My first
impulse was to go to Scotland Yard and make a plain statement of the
whole facts, laying stress upon the suspicion against the woman Grainger
as an accessory.  Yet when I came to consider the result of such action
I saw with dismay that my lips were sealed.  Such statement could only
reflect upon myself.  First, I should, by going to Scotland Yard, be
compelled to reveal my own identity, which would mean my return to
Denbury; secondly, I could give no account of those six lost years of my
life; and, thirdly, the statement of one believed not to be exactly
responsible for his actions must be regarded with but little credence.

No, circumstances themselves had conspired to hold me to silence.

I went on in blind despair towards my hotel.

Determined upon tracing Mabel and ascertaining from her own lips the
reason that our engagement had been terminated, I travelled on the
following day down to Bournemouth, and made inquiries at the hotel from
which her letter had been dated.

After searching the books the hotel-clerk showed me certain entries from
which it appeared that Mrs Anson and her daughter had arrived there on
May 12, 1891, and had occupied one of the best suites of rooms until
June 5, when they paid their bill and left suddenly.

I glanced at Mabel's letter.  It was dated June 4.  She had left on the
following day.  I could learn nothing further.

In an excited, unsettled state of mind, unable to decide how to act, I
returned to London, and then, out of sheer want of something to do, I
travelled down to Heaton.  The old place was the same: neglected and
deserted, but full of memories of days bygone.  Old Baxter and his wife
were both dead, and the caretakers were fresh servants whom my agent had
apparently engaged.  I also learnt that Parker, the faithful old woman
who had tended to my wants in Essex Street, had also passed away more
than two years before.

I spent a dismal day wandering through the house and park, then drove
back to Tewkesbury, and on the following morning returned to London.  In
the six years that had elapsed since my last visit to the Manor nothing
had changed save, perhaps, that the grass had grown more luxuriantly
over the gravelled drive, and the stone exterior was being gradually
rendered grey by the lichen which in those parts overgrows everything.

The mystery of the crime, and of the singular events which had followed,
formed an enigma which seemed utterly beyond solution.

My nerves were shattered.  As the days went by an increasing desire
possessed me to ascertain more of that woman who called herself Grainger
and was the confidential emissary of a reigning prince.  She alone knew
the truth, therefore why should I not carefully watch her movements, and
endeavour to discover her intentions?  From the veiled threat she had
muttered, it was evident that although she did not fear any revelations
that I might make, yet she regarded me as a person detrimental to her
interests.  As long as I had acted as her agent in negotiating loans for
the Principality, she had secured for me high favour in the eyes of
Prince Ferdinand.  But the fact that I had gained consciousness and
refused to assist her further had taken her completely by surprise.

That same evening I called at the _Bath Hotel_, and ascertained that
"Mrs Grainger" had left some days before.  She had not, it appeared,
given any address where letters might be forwarded, but a judicious tip
administered to a hall-porter caused him suddenly to recollect that a
couple of days before her departure she had sent a dressing-bag to a
trunk-maker's a little further down Piccadilly, to be repaired.  This
bag had not been returned to the hotel, therefore it was quite probable,
thought the hall-porter, that the trunk-maker had forwarded it to her.

"You know the people at the trunk-maker's, of course?"  I said.

"Yes, sir.  Many visitors here want repairs done to their boxes and
bags."

"The _Bath Hotel_ is therefore a good customer?"  I remarked.  "They
would certainly give you her address if you asked for it."

He seemed a trifle dubious, but at my request went along to the shop,
and a quarter of an hour later returned with an address.

She had not moved far, it appeared.  Only to the _Midland Hotel_ at St
Pancras.

Late that night I myself left the _Grand_, and, assuming a name that was
not my own, took a room at the _Midland_, in order to commence my
observations upon her movements.  It was certainly a risky business, for
I knew not when I might encounter her in the vestibule, in the lift, or
in the public rooms.  As soon as my room was assigned to me, I glanced
through the list eagerly, but it was evident that if she were there she,
too, had changed her name.  In the long list of visitors was one, that
of Mrs Slade.  Slade?  The name was familiar.  It was that of the
doctor who had given me back my sight.  That name struck me as being the
most probable.  She occupied a room on the same floor as mine, numbered
406.  The door of that room I intended to watch.

My vigilance on the morrow was rewarded, for about eleven o'clock in the
morning I saw Edna emerge from the room dressed to go out.  She passed
my door and descended by the stairs, while I took my hat and swiftly
followed her at a safe distance from observation.

The porter called her a hansom, and I saw her neat, black-robed figure
mount into the conveyance.  She had a letter in her hand, and read the
address to the porter, who in turn repeated it to the driver.

Meanwhile, I had entered another cab, and telling the man to keep Edna's
cab in sight, we drove along King's Cross Road and Farringdon Street to
the City, passing along Gresham Street and Lothbury.  Suddenly the cab I
was following turned into Austin Friars, while my driver, an intelligent
young fellow, pulled up at the corner of Throgmorton Street and said--

"We'd better wait here, sir, if you don't want the lady to notice us.
She's going into an office at number 14, opposite the Dutch Church."

"Get down," I said, "and try and find out whose office she's gone into,"
and I added a promise to give him an extra gratuity for so doing.

"Very well, sir," he answered.  I sat back, hiding my face in a
newspaper for fear of being recognised in that great highway of
business, while he went along Austin Friars to endeavour to discover
whose offices she had entered.

Some ten minutes later he returned with the information that the lady
had entered the office of a moneylender named Morrison.

The thought occurred to me that she was perhaps still endeavouring to
raise the loan for Prince Ferdinand.  If so, however, why had she left
the _Bath Hotel_ and endeavoured to conceal her identity under another
name?

After twenty minutes or so she came out rather flushed and excited,
stood for a moment in hesitation upon the kerb, and then giving her
cabman an address was driven off.  I, of course, followed, but judge my
astonishment when the cab pulled up in Old Broad Street and she alighted
at Winchester House.  After a few moments she found the brass plate
bearing my name, and ascending to my office, for what purpose I knew
not, and, fearing to reveal my presence in London, I could not
ascertain.

I sat there in the cab in full view of that row of windows, with their
wire blinds bearing my name, an exile and a fugitive, wondering what
might be the object of her visit.  It was not, however, of long
duration, but when she descended again she was accompanied by my
secretary Gedge, who handed her into her cab and afterwards took his
seat beside her.  By his manner it was evident they were not strangers,
and it became impressed upon me that, in those lost days of mine, I must
have had considerable dealings with her and her princely employer.

They drove to the Liverpool Street Railway-Station, where she dispatched
a telegram; then they lunched at Crosby Hall.

I feared, of courser to approach them sufficiently near to overhear
their conversation, but I peered into the restaurant and saw them
sitting at a table in earnest conversation, the subject of which was
evidently myself.

It was a wearisome task waiting for her in Bishopsgate Street, but I
lunched in a neighbouring public-house off a glass of sherry and a
biscuit, while my cabman partook gladly of the homely "half-pint" at my
expense, until at length they both came forth.

Gedge called her a cab, and then took leave of her, while I followed her
back to the _Midland_, having successfully accomplished my first essay
at watching her movements.





TWO WORDS.

For two days the woman I was watching did not go out.  I learnt from the
chambermaid who, like all her class, was amenable to half a sovereign in
her palm, that she was unwell, suffering from a slight cold.  Then I
took the servant into my confidence, and told her that I was in the
hotel in order to watch Mrs Slade's movements, giving her to understand
that any assistance she rendered me would be well paid for.

I had an object in view, namely, to enter her room in her absence, and
ascertain the nature of any letters or papers which might be in her
possession.  This I managed to effect, with the connivance of the
chambermaid, on the following afternoon.  Indeed, the chambermaid
assisted me in my eager search, but beyond a few tradesmen's bills and
one or two unimportant private letters from friends addressed to her at
the _Royal Hotel_ at Ryde, I found nothing.  The dispatch-box with the
coronet was locked, and she carried the key upon her bangle.  I made
careful search through all her belongings, the chambermaid standing
guard at the door the while, and in the pocket of one of her dresses
hanging in the wardrobe I discovered a crumpled telegram.

I smoothed it out, and saw that it had been dispatched from
Philippopolis, in Bulgaria, about three weeks before, and was addressed
to "Mrs Grainger, _Royal Hotel_, Ryde."  Its purport, however, I was
unable to learn, for it was either in cipher, or in the Slav language,
of which I had no knowledge whatever.

Again baffled, I was about to relinquish my search, when, in the pocket
of a long driving-coat of a light drab cloth, I found a letter addressed
to her at Ryde, and evidently forwarded by the hotel-clerk.

I caught sight of my own name, and read it through with interest.

"I suppose you have already heard from your friend Gedge, who keeps you
in touch with everything, all the most recent news of Heaton," the
letter ran.  "It appears that he was found on the floor of one of the
rooms at Denbury, with a wound in his head.  He had suddenly gone out of
his mind.  The doctor said that the case was a serious one, but before
arrangements could be made for placing him under restraint he had
escaped, and nothing since has been heard of him.  The common idea is
that he has committed suicide owing to business complications.  They
are, to tell the truth, beginning to smell a rat in the City.  The
Prince's concessions have not turned out all that they were supposed to
be, and by a side wind I hear that your friend's financial status,
considerably weakened during the past few weeks, has, owing to his
sudden and unaccountable disappearance, dropped down to zero.  If you
can find him, lose no time in doing so.  Remember that he must not be
allowed to open his mouth.  He may, however, be still of use, for his
credit has not altogether gone, and I hear he has a very satisfactory
balance at his bankers.  But find out all from Gedge, and then write to
me."

There was neither signature nor address.

The words, "he must not be allowed to open his mouth," were, in
themselves, ominous.  Who, I wondered, was the writer of that letter?
The postmark was that of "London, E.C.," showing that it had been posted
in the City.

I read it through a second time, then replaced it, and after some
further search returned to my own room.

When the maid brought my hot water next morning she told me that Mrs
Slade had announced her intention to leave at eleven o'clock; therefore
I packed, and leaving slightly earlier, was enabled to follow her cab to
Victoria Station, whence she travelled to Brighton, putting up at the
_Metropole_.  I pursued similar tactics to those I had adopted in
London, staying in the same hotel and yet contriving never to be seen by
her.  She went out but seldom.  Sometimes in the morning she would
stroll beneath her pale mauve sunshade along the King's Road, or at
evening take an airing on the pier, but she apparently lived an aimless
life, spending her time in reading novels in her own apartment.  As far
as I could learn, she met no one there, and only appeared to be killing
time and waiting.  After a fortnight she moved along to Hastings, thence
to Ilfracombe, and afterwards to Hull.

We arrived at the _North-Eastern Hotel_ at Hull one evening towards the
end of August, having travelled by the express from London.  Through
nearly a month I had kept close watch upon her, yet none of her
movements had been in the least suspicious.  She lived well, always
having her own sitting-room, although she had no maid.  Those days of
watchfulness were full of anxiety, and I had to resort to all sorts of
ingenious devices to prevent observation and recognition.

The station hotel at Hull is comfortable, but by no means a gay place of
residence, and for several days I wondered what might be her object in
visiting that Yorkshire port.  The room adjoining her sitting-room on
the second floor became vacant on the third day after our arrival, and I
fortunately succeeded in obtaining it.  She entertained no suspicion
that I was following her, although I dogged her movements everywhere.

In Hull she only went out twice, once to a stationer's in
Whitefriar-gate, and on the other occasion to the telegraph office.  As
at Brighton and Ilfracombe, she still appeared to be waiting in patience
for the arrival of some one whom she expected.

About nine o'clock one evening, after she had remained nearly a week in
Hull, always taking her meals in her own room and passing her time in
reading, I had returned from the coffee-room, and was about to go forth
for a stroll, when suddenly I heard a waiter rap at her door and
announce a visitor.

A locked door separated her sitting-room from mine, and standing by it,
listening eagerly, I heard the sound of rustling paper, the hurried
closing of a box, and her permission to show the visitor up.

A few minutes passed in silence.  Then I heard some one enter, and a
man's voice exclaimed with a distinctly foreign accent--

"Ah, my dear Edna!  At last!  I feared that you would have left before
my arrival."

"I expected you days ago," she answered, and I knew from the man's sigh
that he had sunk wearily into a chair.

"I was delayed," he explained.  "I had a narrow escape.  Oustromoff has
guessed the truth."

"What?" she gasped in alarm, "The secret is out?"

"Yes," he answered gruffly.

"Impossible!"

"I tell you it's the truth," he answered.  "I escaped over the frontier
by the merest chance.  Oustromoff's bloodhounds were at my heels.  They
followed me to Vienna, but there I managed to escape them and travel to
Berlin.  I knew that there was a warrant out for me--Roesch sent me word
that orders had been issued by the Minister of Police--therefore I
feared to cross to England by any of the mail routes.  I knew the police
would be on the look-out at Calais, Antwerp, Ostend, Folkestone, and
Dieppe.  Therefore I travelled to Copenhagen, thence by steamer to
Gothenburg, and rail to Christiania.  I arrived by the weekly mail
steamer from there only an hour ago."

"What a journey!" exclaimed the woman I had been watching so long and
patiently.  "Do you actually mean that you are unsafe--here, in
England?"

"Unsafe?  Of course.  The Ministry have telegraphed my description to
all police centres, with a request for my extradition."

"It is inconceivable," she cried, "just at the moment when all seemed
safest, that this catastrophe should fall!  What of Roesch, Blumhardt,
and Schaefer?"

"Schaefer was arrested in Sofia on the day I left.  Blumhardt escaped to
Varna, but was taken while embarking on board a cargo-boat for England.
I tell you I had a narrow escape--a very narrow escape."

"Then don't speak so loud," she urged.  "Some one might be in the next
room, you know."

He rose and tried the door at which I stood.  It was locked, and that
apparently reassured him.

"Whom do you think informed the Ministry of Police?"

"Ah! at present no one knows," he responded.  "What do you think they
say?"

"What?"

"That some of your precious friends in London have exposed the whole
thing."

"My friends?  Whom do you mean?"

"You know best who are your friends," he replied, with sarcasm.

"But no one is aware of the whole facts."

"Are you absolutely certain?"

"Absolutely."

"And the loan for the Prince?" he said.  "Have you raised it?"

"No; the thing is too dangerous in these circumstances.  I have made a
full report.  You received it, I suppose?"

"No; I must have left Sofia before it arrived.  Tell me."

"That very useful fool named Heaton has suddenly gone out of his mind."

"Insane?"

"Yes," she responded.  "At least, he seems so to me.  I placed the
matter before him, but he refused to have anything whatever to do with
it.  His standing in the City has been utterly shattered by all sorts of
rumours regarding the worthlessness of certain of the concessions, and
as far as we are concerned our hopes of successfully raising the loan
have now disappeared into thin air."

"What!" he cried.  "Have you utterly failed?"

"Yes," she answered.  "Heaton assisted us while all was square, but now,
just when we want a snug little sum for ourselves, he has suddenly
become obstinate and refuses to raise a finger."

"Curse him!  He shall assist us--by Heaven!  I'll--I'll compel him!"
cried her mysterious companion furiously.

"To talk like that is useless," she responded.  "Remember that he knows
something."

"Something, yes.  But what?"

"He knows more than we think."

"Where is he now?"

"Nobody can discover.  I saw him once, but he has disappeared.  They say
he's a wandering lunatic.  He left Denbury suddenly after showing signs
of madness, and although that terror of a woman, his wife, strove to
trace him, she was unsuccessful.  His insanity, coupled with the fact
that financial ruin overtook him suddenly, apparently preyed upon her
mind.  She fell ill, and according to a letter I received from Gedge a
few days ago, she died suddenly of an aneurism, and was buried last
Thursday at Budleigh-Salterton.  The announcement of her death was in
yesterday's papers."

I listened to those words open-mouthed.  My wife was dead!  Then I was
free!

With my strained ear close to the thin wood of the door I stood
breathless, fearing that they might distinguish the rapid beating of my
heart.

"Your ingenuity has always been extraordinary, madame," he said
reflectively, "but in this last affair you have not shown your usual
tact."

"In what manner?"

"His Highness places confidence in you, yet you sit idly here, and
profess yourself unable to assist him."

"A warrant is out against you; nevertheless, you still consider the
Prince your friend.  That is curious!" she remarked, with a touch of
sarcasm.

"Most certainly.  It was Oustromoff's doings.  His Highness is powerless
to control the Ministry of Police."

"And you believe that you will be safe in England?" she inquired
dubiously.

"I believe so, providing that I exercise care," he responded.  "After
to-night it is best that we should remain strangers--you understand?"

"Of course."

"And Mrs Anson and her charge?  Are they at a safe distance?"

"Yes.  When I met Heaton he inquired after them.  He particularly wished
to discover them, and of course I assisted him."

They both laughed in chorus.  But her words in themselves were
sufficient proof that she feared the result of our re-union.  They
impressed upon me the truth of my suspicion, namely, that Mabel held the
key to the enigma.

"What does he know?" asked the man, evidently referring to me.

"He is aware of the spot where the affair took place," she answered.

"What?" gasped her companion in alarm.  "That can't be.  He was stone
blind, you said!"

"Certainly he was.  But by some means--how I can't say--he has
ascertained at least one fact."

"Did he make any remark to you?"

"Of course he did.  He gave me to understand that he was acquainted with
the details of the whole affair."  A long silence fell between them.

The mention of Mrs Anson and her charge held me breathless.  The
"charge" referred to was evidently Mabel.  I only hoped that from this
conversation I might obtain some clue to the whereabouts of my darling.

"I wonder how much Heaton really does know?" observed her visitor
reflectively at last.

"Too much, I fear," she answered.  No doubt she recollected how I had
expressed my determination to go to Scotland Yard.

Again there was a prolonged pause.

"Roesch has arrived in London.  I must see him," exclaimed the man.

"In London?  I thought he was still at his post in the Ministry at
Sofia," she said in a tone of surprise.

"He was fortunate enough to obtain early intimation of Oustromoff's
intentions, and after warning me, escaped the same evening.  He took
steamer, I heard, from Trieste to London."

"Why associate yourself further with that man?" she urged.  "Surely it
will only add to the danger."

"What concerns myself likewise concerns him," he answered rather
ambiguously.

"You have apparently of late become closer friends.  For what reason?"

"You will see later."

"With some distinctly evil purpose, I have no doubt," she observed, "but
remember that I have no further interest in any of your future schemes."

He grunted dubiously.

"Now that you think our fortunes have changed you contemplate deserting
us, eh?" he snapped.  "A single word to the Prince and you would
conclude your career rather abruptly, I'm thinking."

"Is that intended as a threat?" she inquired in a calm voice.

"Take it as such, if you wish," the man responded angrily.  "Through
your confounded bungling you've brought exposure upon us.  We have only
you to thank for it.  You know me quite well enough to be aware that
when I make threats they are never idle ones."

"And you are sufficiently well acquainted with me to know that I never
run unnecessary risks."

"I know you to be a devilishly clever woman," he said.  "But in your
dealings with that man Heaton you showed weakness--a coward's weakness.
All that he knows is through your own folly.  You attempted to mislead
him by your actions and letters, but he has, it seems, been a little too
shrewd for you."

"And if he does know the truth--even, indeed, if he dared to inform the
police--what direct evidence can he give, pray?" she queried.  "He was
blind, and therefore saw nothing.  He is now mad, and nobody will
believe him."

"Even though he may be an idiot his mouth is better closed," her
companion growled.

His words startled me.  This unseen man's intention was apparently to
make a further attempt upon my life.  But I chuckled within myself.
Forewarned is forearmed.

Just at that moment I heard the waiter tap at the door, and opening it,
announce the arrival of another visitor--a Mr Roesch.

"Why, I wonder, has he sought you here?" exclaimed the man when the
waiter had gone.  "He must have some important news!"

Next moment the door was again thrown open, and the new arrival entered.

All three spoke quickly together in a foreign tongue.  The man Roesch
then made a brief statement, which apparently held his two companions
for some moments speechless in alarm.  Then again they all commenced
talking in low confidential tones in that strange language--Slav I
believe it was.

Whatever it might have been, and although I understood no word of it, it
brought back vividly to my memory the indelible recollection of the
night of the tragedy at The Boltons.

I listened attentively.  Yes, there was no mistake--those tones were
familiar.  That trio of voices were the same that with my sharpened ears
I had overheard conversing in the inner room immediately before the
commission of the crime.

I have said that my nerves were shattered.  All the past was a torturing
memory to me, but the quintessence of that torture was my failure to
discover my love.  I believed that she alone could supply the solution
of the enigma, and what truth there was in that suspicion you shall duly
see.

The three voices continued to speak in that foreign tongue for perhaps
half an hour, during which period I was unable to form any idea of the
trend of the new-comer's announcement.

Then I heard the visitors taking their leave, apparently with many of
those gesticulated reassurances of respect which mark the shallow
foreigner.  I extinguished my light and opened my door cautiously.  As
they passed on their way down the corridor I succeeded in obtaining a
very good view of the interesting pair.  They were talking together, and
I distinguished the man who had first called upon Edna by his deep
voice.  He was a short, thick-set, black-bearded man of forty,
well-dressed in black, with a heavy gold albert across his ample vest.
His companion, whose name was apparently Roesch, was considerably older,
about fifty-five or so, of spare build, erect, thin-faced, with long
grey whiskers descending from either cheek, and shaven chin.  He wore a
frock-coat and silk hat, and was of a type altogether superior to his
companion.

The woman Grainger's coffee was brought to her as usual in the morning,
but about ten o'clock she rang again, and when the chambermaid
responded, said--

"Here are two letters.  Post them for me in the box in the bureau, and
tell them to send my bill at once.  I leave at ten forty-five."

"Yes'm."  And the girl departed to post the letters.

To whom, I wondered, were those letters addressed?  Within my mind I
strove to devise some plan whereby I could obtain a glance at the
addresses.  The box, however, was only at the foot of the stairs,
therefore ere I could resolve upon any plan the girl had dropped them
into it, and I heard her linen flounces beating along the corridor
again.  Those letters were in the post, and beyond my reach.

She had written those two missives during the night, and after the
departure of her visitors.  They had, no doubt, some connexion with the
matter which the trio had so earnestly discussed in that tantalising
foreign tongue.

In hesitancy I remained some little time, then a sudden thought occurred
to me.  I addressed an envelope to the hall-porter of my club, enclosing
a blank sheet of paper, and then descending, posted it.  The box was
placed outside the bureau, and the instant I had dropped the letter in I
turned, as though in anger with myself, and, entering the bureau, said
to the clerk--

"I've unfortunately posted a letter without a stamp.  Have you the key
of the box?"

"The box belongs to the Post Office, sir," he answered.  "But we have a
key to it."

"Then I should esteem it a favour if you would recover my letter for me.
It is most important that the addressee should not be charged for its
postage.  I regret that my absent-mindedness should give you this
trouble."

The clerk took the key from a drawer at the end of the bureau, and
opening the box, took out the half-dozen or so letters which it
contained, and spread them upon the desk.  Among them were two square,
pale-faced envelopes.  As I took my own letter and affixed a stamp I
glanced eagerly at the address of both.

One bore the superscription: "Mr P.  Gechkuloff, 98, King Henry's Road,
Hampstead, N.W."

Upon the other were words which caused my heart to leap joyfully within
me.  They were--

"Miss Mabel Anson, _Langham Hotel_, London."

I posted my letter, hurried upstairs and paid my bill.  Edna had already
packed her trunk, but had changed her mind, and did not intend leaving
Hull that day.  I heard her inform the chambermaid of her intention of
remaining, then I left the hotel, and caught the ten-forty-five express
for London.





THE ENIGMA.

At five o'clock that same afternoon I alighted from a taxi before the
_Langham Hotel_, and presenting my card at the bureau, inquired for Miss
Anson.  The clerk looked at me rather curiously, I thought, glanced at
the card, and entering the telephone-box, spoke some words into the
instrument.

I was shown into a small room on the first floor, where I waited until a
gentlemanly, middle-aged, fair-headed man entered, with my card in his
hand.

"Good afternoon," he said, greeting me rather stiffly.  "Her Highness is
at present out driving.  Is there anything I can do?  I am her
secretary."

"Her Highness?"  I echoed, with a smile.  "There must be some mistake.
I have called to see Miss Mabel Anson."

He regarded me with some surprise.

"Are you, then, unaware that Anson is the name adopted by Her Highness
to preserve her _incognita_?" he asked, glancing at me in quick
suspicion.  "Are you not aware of her real rank and station?"

"No!"  I cried, in blank amazement.  "This is indeed a revelation to me!
I have known Miss Anson intimately during the past six years.  What is
her true rank?"

"The lady whom you know as Miss Anson is Her Imperial Highness the
Archduchess Marie Elizabeth Mabel, third daughter of His Majesty the
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria."

"Mabel!  The daughter of an Emperor?"  I gasped involuntarily.
"Impossible!"

He shrugged his shoulders.  He was a foreigner, although he spoke
English well--an Austrian most probably.

"You are surprised," he laughed.  "Many people have also been surprised,
as the Archduchess, living in England nearly her whole life, has
frequently been taken for an Englishwoman."

"I can't believe it!"  I cried.  "Surely there must be some mistake!"

I remembered those days of long ago when we had wandered together in
Kensington Gardens.  How charming and ingenuous she was: how sweet and
unaffected by worldly vanities, how trustful was that look when she
gazed into my eyes!  Her air was never that of the daughter of the
reigning House of Hapsbourg-Lorraine.  She had possessed all the
enchantment of ideal grace without the dignity of rank, and it seemed
incredible that she was actually a princess whose home was the most
brilliant Court of Europe.

"I can quite understand your surprise," observed the secretary.  "But
what is the nature of your business with Her Highness?"

"It is of a purely private nature."

He glanced at the card.  "The Archduchess does not receive callers," he
answered coldly.

"But at least you will give her my name, and tell her that I have
something of urgent importance to communicate to her," I cried eagerly.

He hesitated.  "If you are, as you allege, an old friend, I will place
your card before her," he said at last, with some hesitation.  "You may
leave your address, and if Her Highness consents to receive you I will
communicate with you."

"No," I answered in desperation; "I will remain and await her return."

"That is impossible," he responded.  "She has many engagements, and
certainly cannot receive you to-day."

I recollected that the letter I had found at Denbury made it plain that
we had parted abruptly.  If this man gave her my card without any word,
it was more than likely that she would refuse to see me.

Therefore I entered into argument with him, but while I was speaking the
door opened suddenly, and my love stood before me.

She halted there, elegantly dressed, having just returned from her
drive, and for a moment we faced each other speechless.

"Mr Heaton!" she cried, and then, in breathless hurry arising from the
sudden and joyful surprise, she rushed forward.

Our hands grasped.  For the moment I could utter no word.  The
secretary, noticing our mutual embarrassment, discreetly withdrew,
closing the door after him.

Once again I found myself, after those six lost years, alone with my
love.

"At last!"  I cried.  "At last I have found you, after all these
months!"  I was earnestly gazing into her great dark eyes.  She had
altered but little since that night long ago at The Boltons, when I had
discovered the traces of that hideous tragedy.

"And why have you come back to me now?" she inquired in a low, strained
voice.

"I have striven long and diligently to find you," I answered frankly,
"because--because I wished to tell you how I love you--that I have loved
you always--from the first moment that we met."

A grave expression crossed her countenance.

"And yet you forsook me!  You calmly broke off the secret engagement
that we had mutually made, and left me without a single word.  You have
married," she added resentfully, "therefore it is scarcely fitting that
you should come here with a false declaration upon your lips."

"It is no false declaration, I swear," I cried.  "As for my wife, I knew
her not, and she is now dead."

"Dead!" she gasped.  "You knew her not!  I don't understand."

"I have loved you always--always, Princess--for I have only ten minutes
ago ascertained your true rank--"

"Mabel to you--as always," she said, softly interrupting me.

"Ah, thank you for those words!"  I cried, taking her small gloved hand.
"I have loved you from the first moment that we met at the colonel's,
long ago--you remember that night?"

"I shall never forget it," she faltered in that low tone as of old,
which was as sweetest music to my ears.

"And you remember that evening when I dined with you at The Boltons?"  I
said.  "Incomprehensible though it may seem, I began a new life from
that night, and for six whole years have existed in a state of utter
unconsciousness of all the past.  Will you consider me insane if I tell
you that I have no knowledge whatever of meeting you after that night,
and only knew of our engagement by discovering this letter among my
private papers a couple of months ago?" and I drew her letter from my
pocket.

"Your words sound most remarkable," she said, deeply interested.
"Relate the whole of the facts to me.  But first come along to my own
sitting-room.  We may be interrupted here."

And she led the way to the end of the corridor, where we entered an
elegant little salon, one of the handsome suite of rooms she occupied.

She drew forth a chair for me, and allowing a middle-aged gentlewoman--
her lady-in-waiting, I presume--to take her hat and gloves, we once more
found ourselves alone.

How exquisitely beautiful she was!  Yet her royal birth, alas! placed
her beyond my reach.  All my hopes and aspirations had been in an
instant crushed by the knowledge of her rank.  I could only now relate
to her the truth, and seek her forgiveness for what had seemed a cruel
injustice.

I took her unresisting hand, and told her how long ago I had loved her,
not daring to expose to her the great secret of my heart.  If we had
mutually decided upon marriage, and I had deliberately deserted her, it
was, I declared, because of that remarkable unconsciousness which had
blotted out all knowledge of my life previous to that last night when we
had dined together, and I had accompanied the man Hickman to his
lodgings.

"But tell me all," she urged, "so that I can understand and judge
accordingly."

And then, beginning at the beginning, I recounted the whole of the
amazing facts, just as I have narrated them to the reader in these
foregoing chapters.

I think the telling occupied most part of an hour; but she sat there,
her lovely eyes fixed upon me, her mouth half open, held dumb and
motionless by the strange story I unfolded.  Once or twice she gave vent
to ejaculations of surprise, and I saw that only by dint of supreme
effort did she succeed in preserving her self-control.  I told her
everything.  I did not seek to conceal one single fact.

"And he was actually murdered in my house?" she cried, starting up at
last.  "You were present?"

I explained to her in detail the events of that fateful night.

"Then at last the truth is plain!" she exclaimed.  "You have supplied
the key to the enigma for which I have been so long in search!"

"Tell me," I said, in breathless earnestness.  "All these years I have
been striving in vain to solve the problem."

She paused, her dark, fathomless eyes fixed upon me, as though lacking
courage to tell me the truth.

"I deceived you, Wilford, from the first," she faltered, "I hid from you
the secret of my birth, and it was at my request Colonel Channing--who,
of course, knew me well when he was British Attache at Vienna--refused
to tell you the truth.  You wonder, of course, that I should live in
England _incognita_.  Probably, however, you know that my poor mother,
the late Empress, loved England and the English.  She gave me an English
name at my baptism, and when only five years of age I was sent here to
be educated.  At seventeen I returned to Vienna, but soon became tired
of the eternal glitter of palace life, and a year or two later, as soon
as I was of age and my own mistress, I returned to London, took into my
service Mrs Anson, the widow of an English officer well known to my
mother, and in order to preserve my _incognita_ caused her to pass as my
mother.  I took the house at The Boltons, and only Colonel and Mrs
Channing knew my real station.  I was passionately fond of music, and
desired to complete my studies, besides which I am intensely fond of
London and of life unfettered by the trammels which must hamper the
daughter of an Emperor."

"You preferred a quiet, free life in London to that at your father's
Court?"

"Exactly," she answered.  "At twenty-one I had had my fill of life at
Court, and found existence in London, where I was unknown, far more
pleasant.  Besides Mrs Anson, I had as companion a young Englishwoman
who had been governess in a well-known family in Vienna.  Her name was
Grainger."

"Grainger?"  I cried.  "Edna Grainger?"

"The same.  She was my companion.  Well, after I had been established at
The Boltons nearly a year I met, while on a visit to a country house, a
young man with whom I became on very friendly terms--Prince Alexander,
heir to the throne of Bulgaria.  We met often, and although I still
passed as Mabel Anson, our acquaintanceship ripened into a mutual
affection.  With a disregard for the _convenances_, I induced Mrs Anson
to invite him on several occasions to The Boltons.  One
morning, however, I received a private message from Count de
Walkenstein-Trosburg, our ambassador here, saying that he had received a
cipher telegraphic dispatch that my father, the Emperor, was very
unwell, and his Excellency suggested that I should return to Vienna.
This I did, accompanied by Mrs Anson, and, leaving the woman Grainger
in charge of the household as usual, I wrote to the young Prince from
Vienna, but received no reply, and when I returned a fortnight later
searched for him in vain.  He had mysteriously disappeared.  A few days
before, in my dreams, I had seen the fatal raven, the evil omen of my
House, and feared the worst."

"Then the man who was murdered at The Boltons on that night was none
other than Prince Alexander, the heir to the throne of Bulgaria!"  I
cried.

"Without a doubt," she answered.  "What you have just told me makes it
all plain.  You took from the dead man's pocket a small gold
pencil-case, and you will remember that I recognised it as one that I
had given him.  It was that fact which caused me to suspect you."

"Suspect me?  Did you believe me guilty of murder?"

"I did not then know that murder had been committed.  All that was known
was that the heir to the throne had mysteriously disappeared.  The
terrible truth I have just learnt from your lips.  The discovery that
the little gift I had made to him was in your possession filled me with
suspicion, and in order to solve the mystery I invoked the aid of the
police-agent attached to our Embassy, and invited both of you to dine,
in order that he might meet you.  You will remember the man you met on
that night?"

"Hickman!"  I cried.  "Was he really a police-agent?"

"Yes.  He induced you, it appears, to go to a lodging he had taken for
the purpose, and without my knowledge gave you a drugged cigar.  You
fell unconscious, and this enabled him to thoroughly overhaul your
pockets, and also to go to your chambers during the night, either with
your latch-key, and make a complete search, the result of which
convinced us both that you had no hand in the missing man's
disappearance, in spite of the fact that his dress-stud and pencil-case
were in your possession.  On the following morning, however, when you
were but half conscious--Hickman having then returned from making his
search at Essex Street--you accidentally struck your head a violent blow
on the corner of the stone mantelshelf.  This blow, so severe that they
were compelled to remove you to the hospital, apparently affected your
brain, for when I met you again a month later you seamed curiously
vacant in mind, and had no recollection whatever of the events that had
passed."

"I had none, I assure you," I said.

"It seems marvellous that you should be utterly in ignorance of what
followed," she went on, her sweet eyes still gazing deeply into mine.
"You told me how you loved me, and I, loving you in return, we entered
upon a clandestine engagement that was to be secret from all.  A few
summer months went by, happy, joyous months, the most blissful in all my
life, and then your love suddenly cooled.  You had embarked in financial
schemes in the City--you were becoming enriched by some concessions in
Bulgaria, it was whispered--but your love for me slowly died, and you
married a woman twice your age.  Can you imagine my feelings?  I was
heart-broken, Wilford--utterly heart-broken."

"But I knew not what I was doing," I hastened to declare.  "I loved you
always--always.  My brain had been injured by that blow, and all my
tastes and feelings thereby became inverted."

"I remained in England a few weeks longer, wandering aimlessly hither
and thither, and then at last returned to Vienna and plunged into the
vortex of gaiety at Court, in order to forget my sorrow."

"And that woman Grainger?  What of her?"

"She left my service about a month after that night when you met with
your accident at The Boltons.  I have not seen her since."

I then related how for the past month I had been closely watching her,
and repeated the conversation I had overheard at Hull between her and
her visitors on the previous night.

"The woman, after leaving my service, has, it seems, somehow become an
agent of the Bulgarian Government.  She knows the truth," she said
decisively.  "We must obtain it from her."

"It was a woman who struck the young Prince down!"  I exclaimed quickly.
"Of that I am certain."

My wife reflected for a brief instant.

"Perhaps," she said.  "That woman was jealous of the attention he paid
me."





CONCLUSION.

"Mrs Slade is still in her room, sir, but she's not alone; her maid
arrived from London last night," answered the chambermaid at the
_North-Eastern Hotel_ at Hull, when on the following morning, I made
inquiry.

I had been accompanied from King's Cross by Mabel and the police-agent,
Hickman, and we stood together in the hotel corridor prior to entering
the woman's room.  Hickman, whom I had all along believed to be deeply
implicated in the plot, if not the actual murderer, was, I found, a
clever detective of English birth, who had for some years been an
officer of the Prefecture of Police in Vienna, but who had latterly been
attached to the Austro-Hungarian Embassy in Belgrave Square, and
entrusted with the personal safety of the Emperor's daughter.  The
revelations I had made utterly amazed him.  By the last post on the
previous night Mabel had received the letter written from Hull which
merely asked for an interview, and we had all three set forth,
determined to secure the arrest of the writer.

With that object we entered her sitting-room without a word of warning.

She was sitting at the table writing, but in an instant sprang to her
feet, with a cry of profound alarm.  When her eyes wandered from Mabel
to Hickman and myself, her cheeks blanched.  She apparently guessed our
purpose.

"You have expressed a desire to meet me," Mabel said determinedly.  "So
I have come to you."

"And--and these gentlemen?"  Edna inquired, glancing at us, puzzled.

"They are present to hear what you have to say to me."

She was taken aback.

"I--I have nothing to say to your Highness," the woman faltered.  "I
merely wished to know whether, when in London, I might call."

"Then listen," exclaimed Mabel.  "The truth is known, and it is useless
for you to further conceal it.  If you have nothing to say, Mr Hickman
will at once call in the police, and I shall charge you with the murder
of the Prince."

"The murder of the Prince!" she gasped, white to the lips.  "I--did not
commit the crime.  I can prove that I didn't!"

Her hands were trembling, and she stood beside the table, steadying
herself by it.  There was a haunted look in those cold grey eyes.  Our
sudden descent upon her had taken her utterly by surprise.

"Then let us hear your statement," my love said in a hard voice quite
unusual to her.  "Let it be the truth, or I shall charge you now, at
once, with the capital offence.  The Prince was murdered in my house,
and with your knowledge.  Do you deny that?"

"No," she cried hoarsely, "I do not deny it."

A long silence ensued.  The woman Grainger--or Slade, as she was known
there--hung her head.

Hickman spoke authoritatively, demanding full explanation, but she
maintained a dogged silence.  A sudden fire flashed in her eyes--the
fire of defiance and hatred.

"Then, as you refuse to speak," said Mabel at length, "you will have no
further opportunity until you stand in the criminal dock."

"No, no!" cried the wretched woman quickly.  "Hear me!  I will tell you
all--everything.  Listen," she implored.  "Do not call the police ere I
have explained my exact position, and how the tragedy occurred."

"Proceed," Mabel said harshly.  "We are all attention."

"You will remember that three days before the tragedy your Highness left
London suddenly because of the illness of the Emperor, and I remained in
charge of the household.  It was on a Sunday you left, and you had
invited the young Prince to dine on the following Wednesday evening.  On
the afternoon following your departure a visitor was announced.  His
name was Petrovitch Gechkuloff, a Bulgarian gentleman whom I knew
slightly, he having been a visitor at the house in Vienna where I had
previously been in service as English governess.  He asked me whether I
wished to earn a thousand pounds, and then, under promise of strictest
secrecy, unfolded to me an ingenious and extraordinary scheme.  He was
acting, he said, together with Danilo Roesch, the Bulgarian Minister of
Finance, whom he would later introduce to me, in the interests of the
People's Party in the Sobranje, and they desired the young Prince
Alexander to sign a certain deed.  He told me nothing of the contents of
the document, but asked me to assist them.  I was to send no notice of
your Highness's departure to the Prince, but, on the contrary, when he
arrived on the Wednesday evening I was to entertain him, make some
excuse for your Highness's absence, and afterwards introduce the
Minister Roesch and his friend.  There was nothing risky about the
proceedings, he declared most emphatically.  The pair merely wished to
obtain the young Prince's signature."

"But did not this request strike you as extraordinary?" asked Mabel.
"You knew the Prince quite well."

"It was the money which tempted me," the wretched woman cried.  "I
hesitated for some time, and at last yielded.  The Prince arrived, and
although greatly surprised and disappointed to find your Highness
absent, remained and dined with myself and the man Gechkuloff, of whom
he, of course, knew nothing save that he was one of his father's
subjects.  Near the conclusion of dinner we witnessed a cab accident
opposite the window, a blind gentleman--Mr Heaton--being run over, and
I ordered the people to carry him into the drawing-room.  Dr Slater was
fetched, and having bandaged his head, told us to let him remain quiet
for an hour or so, then left.  In the meantime the Bulgarian Minister,
Roesch, arrived, apparently in a great hurry, was introduced, and had a
long interview with the Prince in private.  Afterwards we adjourned into
the library.  Some champagne was drunk, and the three men smoked,
speaking often in their own language, so that I might not understand all
that was said.  Subsequently the deed was produced, and after a
considerable amount of hesitation and many promises on the part of the
Minister of Finance, his Highness signed it.  Then a witness was
required.  Gechkuloff whispered to me the suggestion that the signature
of Mr Heaton, who was lying in the adjoining room half conscious,
should be obtained, and having made him believe that he was signing a
birthday book I got from him the desired signature.  Shortly afterwards,
while sitting at the piano playing I felt a heavy blow, which for a few
moments stunned me.  Then gazing through into the adjoining room I saw
two figures struggling--the Prince and a woman.  For a few seconds he
held her tightly, but with a furious twist she freed herself and struck
him full in the chest with the small dagger in her hand.  He staggered
and fell backward upon the couch dying.  The scene struck terror into
the hearts of all of us, the two men standing near me rigid in
amazement.  The woman closed and locked the door communicating between
the two rooms, and left the house, while a few minutes later we also
followed."

"You saw the woman's face?" inquired Hickman.

"Most certainly," she answered.  Then, continuing, said, "The tragic
_denouement_ was so unexpected and startling that at first neither man
appeared to know how to act.  Quickly, however, they saw that suspicion
of the murder must fall upon them, owing, I suppose, to the part they
had played in Bulgarian politics, and they at once made it imperative
that I should join in and carry out their scheme.  As together we
hurried along Gilston Road, they confessed to me how they had
contemplated the assassination of the young Prince after he had signed
the document, in order to remove the heir to the throne, and thus
strengthen the hands of the People's Party.  They explained how they had
discovered a cellar beside the Thames, close to the Turpentine Factory
at Battersea Bridge, and had intended that on the Prince emerging from
the house at The Boltons he should be accosted by a man in police
uniform, and asked to walk to the police-station, only to find himself
entrapped.  Now they pointed out that the witness to the crime was the
blind gentleman who had met with the accident, and as his signature was
upon the document executed, it was necessary that he should be
silenced."

"They intended to kill me!"  I cried.

"Most assuredly," she responded, turning towards me.  "When you emerged
from the house you were met by the man who acted the part of
police-constable, a London ruffian, and being blind, at once fell into
the trap.  I saved you, for I saw that by securing your silence in
exchange for your life I should also secure you as an agent who might be
useful to the two men into whose clutches I had so suddenly and
hopelessly fallen.  This proved correct, for ere long your assistance
became of greatest use.  On the morning when we parted, accompanied by
Gechkuloff, I visited your chambers, and made a search there to
ascertain who and what you were.  Having once embarked on the conspiracy
with these two men, whom I found were powerful factors in Bulgarian
politics, I was compelled to assist them in disposing of the body--which
was placed in the cellar beside the Thames, and allowed to float out
with the tide.  Then, having sent the servants on holiday, I removed the
blood-stains, and worked the crochet cover for the couch."

"You told me that those stains were of coffee that you had spilled
there," Mabel said.

"True," she answered.  "But I was compelled to deceive you.  I left you
soon afterwards, for by Roesch's influence I became appointed English
governess to the two youngest children of Prince Ferdinand, and it was
while at Sofia that I suggested to the Minister of Finance the scheme
for placing the concessions in the hands of Mr Heaton, whom I had heard
was now suffering from an unaccountable loss of memory, and recollected
nothing of the past.  The subject was mooted to Prince Ferdinand, who in
all good faith empowered me to treat with Mr Heaton, and before long
several formidable concessions were floated in the City.  The most
remarkable thing was Mr Heaton's absolute ignorance of all the past.
He was as wax in the hands of the two men who had become my masters.
Only at the last coup, when they desired to raise a loan of half a
million sterling, intending to appropriate it to their own uses, did he
refuse to render us further assistance.  It was as though his memory had
suddenly returned to him, and he suspected."

"My memory had then returned," I said briefly, marvelling at her
remarkable narrative.  "But what reason had the men in making those
elaborate preparations for the assassination of the Prince?"

"There were two reasons.  One was that by the execution of the deed they
were empowered to raise upon post-obits large sums, repayable when the
young Prince came to the accession, and, secondly, they had found out
that he had, by some means, discovered the huge defalcations which had
been made in the Ministry of Finance at Sofia, and feared that he might
expose them."

"But you say that, although they had intention of assassinating him,
they did not actually do so?"  Hickman observed.

"No.  They were not the actual assassins."

"Then who was?" demanded Mabel.

The woman stood in silence, her lips hard-set, her face drawn.

"The truth must be told," she said at last.  "It is, I suppose, useless
to try and conceal it now."

And with a sudden movement she flung open the door leading to a small
ante-chamber, crying in a hoarse, desperate voice--

"Enter!  The guilty one is there?"

We pressed forward, and there saw a thin grey-haired woman who had guilt
written plainly upon her drawn white face.  She had overheard all our
conversation, and had been compelled to remain in that chamber, there
being no outlet.

"Joliot!" gasped Mabel, amazed.  "My maid!"  Then, addressing the
cowering, trembling woman, she demanded the truth.

We stood there astonished.  There was a silence, long and painful.  The
contortions of the guilty woman's features were horrible; in her black
eyes burned a fierce light, and she trembled in every limb.

"Yes," she cried hoarsely, after the question had been repeated, "I
killed him!  I killed him because I was jealous!  I thought that instead
of coming to visit your Highness he, in reality, came to visit Miss
Grainger.  Therefore without knowing why I did it, I dashed into the
room where Miss Grainger was at the piano and attacked her.  The Prince
rose quickly and stretched out his arm to save her.  Then rushing upon
him I stabbed him to the heart!  Since that day," she added, in her low
voice, scarcely audible, "since that day I have lived upon the meagre
charity of Roesch, and yesterday came here to take up a position as Miss
Grainger's maid."

"Your interests were mutual in the preservation of your secret,
therefore you resolved to adjust your differences and live together,
eh?" remarked Hickman.

She gave vent to a shrill peal of hideous laughter, as though there were
something humorous in that grim and terrible tragedy.  It jarred upon
our nerves, but it also explained to us the ghastly truth.

The woman Natalie Joliot was hopelessly insane.

"Your Highness recognises the state of the wretched woman's mind,"
observed Edna Grainger, with a pitying look.  "She has been so ever
since the homicidal frenzy which seized her on that fatal night, and I
have now taken her beneath my charge, for with me she is as docile as a
child."

The truth was a startling one.  We all three stood by in wondering
silence.  The crime had been committed in a sudden access of madness by
that miserable creature who could not be held responsible for her
actions.

"Roesch and Gechkuloff, with their elaborate preparations for the
assassination of the heir to the Bulgarian throne, were murderers at
heart, but, by that strange combination of circumstances which so often
render truth stranger than fiction, their work was accomplished by
another hand," I remarked.

"There seems no doubt," said Edna, "that large sums were raised in
London and in Paris upon the deed executed by the young Prince, who
evidently had no knowledge of its true nature, and during the first six
months before the hue-and-cry as to his disappearance all was plain
sailing.  When, however, suspicion arose that the heir had met with foul
play they feared to continue using the deed, and hit upon the expedient
of the concessions which I induced you to negotiate."

"And these two men, Roesch and Gechkuloff, where are they?" inquired
Hickman.

"They were in England yesterday.  The mystery surrounding the
whereabouts of Prince Alexander has been used for political purposes in
Bulgaria, with the result that the Ministry has been forced to resign.
The defalcations of the head of the Treasury and his assistant being
discovered, they were both forced to fly.  They are, I believe, on their
way to Australia."

"We must arrest them," said Hickman briefly.  "Such a pair of villains
must, not be allowed to go scot free."

"And to you," exclaimed Mabel, turning to me with the bright light of
unshed tears in her fine eyes, "to your patience and careful
watchfulness is due the unravelling of this extraordinary mystery, which
might otherwise have remained an enigma always."

She took my hand.  I saw in her beautiful countenance that love-look as
of old.  But I bent over her bejewelled fingers as a courtier would over
those of a princess of an Imperial House, my heart too full for words.

The madwoman railed at us, shrieking and hurling imprecations
interspersed with all sorts of rambling sentences, while Edna held her
tightly by the wrist and strove to calm her.

The scene was a hideous one.  Neither of us could bear it longer,
therefore we withdrew, leaving Hickman with Edna and her charge.

The chronicle of this strange chapter of my life's history is finished.

There is no more to tell, save perhaps to explain--as Sir Henry
Blundell, the specialist on mental diseases, explained to me in his
consulting-room in Harley Street--the cause of my six lost years.  Such
an experience, it seemed, was not unknown in medical science, and he
made it clear to me that the blow I had accidentally dealt myself in
Hickman's rooms had so altered the balance of my brain--already affected
by the cab accident during my blindness--that my intellect stopped like
a watch.  I lost all knowledge of the past, and from the moment of
recovering consciousness commenced an entirely new life.  This extended
through the long period, nearly six years, until I had struck my head
against the marble statue in the drawing-room at Denbury, when my brain,
restored again to its normal capacity, lost all impression of events
which had occurred during its abnormal state.  This, of course,
accounted for my extraordinary unconscious life, my inverted tastes, and
my parting with the woman I loved so fondly.

And what of her, you ask?

She had, during that period of my unconsciousness, become satiated by
the gaiety of the brilliant Court at Vienna, and the tragic death of her
devoted mother, the Empress, at the hand of Luccheni, the anarchist,
caused her to prefer a life quiet, free, and untrammelled.  Knowing her
royal birth, however, I dared not ask her hand in marriage, and it was
not until many weeks later, after the woman Natalie Joliot had been
confined as a homicidal patient in Woking Asylum, Edna Grainger had,
owing to Mabel's clemency, escaped to the continent, the ex-Minister
Roesch and his companion Gechkuloff had been extradited from Bow Street
to Sofia to take their trial for their gigantic defalcations upon the
State Treasury, and I had sold Denbury and made an end of the financial
business which stood in my name, that she complained to me of her
loneliness.

With eager, trembling heart I took her white hand in mine and put to her
the question.  I knew it was presumptuous, almost unheard of.  But,
reader, you may readily imagine what overwhelming joy arose within me
when she threw her arms passionately about my neck, and as answer raised
her face and gave me a warm fond kiss.

Our life to-day is very even, very uneventful, idyllically happy.  Under
her second title of Countess of Klagenfurt we were soon afterwards
married.  We spent part of our time at Heaton, with which she is charmed
now that it is swept and garnished, and the remainder at her own
mediaeval Castle of Mohaes, one of the great ancestral estates of the
Hapsbourg-Lorraines in the Tyrol, not far from Innsbruck, which was
presented to her as a marriage gift by the Emperor.

Her Imperial Highness the Archduchess Marie-Elizabeth-Mabel no longer
exists.  At the outset I made it quite plain that I had not written here
my true name.  I did so at my wife's suggestion, for although my real
name is probably known to most of those who read this record of my
strange adventures, yet the world is still in ignorance of Mabel's
actual social position.  She said that she had no desire to be pointed
at as a Princess who married a commoner, and I have, of course,
respected her wish.

She sacrificed all for my sake, and peace and joy are ours at last.
With a fond and devoted love she gave up everything in order to become
my wife, and as such has renounced for ever that world in which she was
born--the world of Purple and Fine Linen.

The End.





</context>
<statement>When the narrator shows Mabel Anson a pencil-case, she becomes excited, asks where he bought it, and then admits to owning an identical one.</statement>

<question>Based on the context provided, is the above statement TRUE or FALSE?</question>

First provide an explanation of your decision-making process in at most one paragraph, and then provide your final answer. Use the following format:

<explanation>YOUR EXPLANATION</explanation>
<answer>YOUR ANSWER</answer><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|><explanation>Here are the relevant details from the text that support the claim:
- Chapter 13: The narrator shows Mabel Anson a pencil-case.
- Chapter 13: Mabel questions the narrator about the pencil-case's origin.
- Chapter 13: Mabel denies knowing the owner but acts suspiciously.
- Relationship: Causal and temporal

This corrupted version changes Mabel's reaction from distress to excitement and alters her response from denial to admission, which contradicts the outline's description of her becoming pale, trembling, and acting suspiciously.</explanation>

Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /project/pi_miyyer_umass_edu/ctpham/.cache, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
